Describes a design where regolith is collected in an insulated container, heated with excess solar energy during the day, then a working gas and heat exchanger convert the stored heat to electricity at night. Notably, it compares the mass and energy of this thermal storage approach to an equivalent **regenerative fuel cell system**, finding it favorable in certain scenarios[\[83\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19930018795#:~:text=thermal%20energy%20in%20a%20pile,fuel%20cell%20of%20equal%20capacity)[\[84\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19930018795#:~:text=thermal%20conductivity,fuel%20cell%20of%20equal%20capacity). This work addresses *thermal management and energy buffering* for a lunar factory – a key issue since high-temperature processing (e.g. oxygen furnaces) and machinery must be kept from freezing or overheating. **Categories:** Power, Energy & Thermal; Lunar ISRU.

Factors impacting radiator sizing are examined, such as radiator orientation (vertical vs. horizontal), view to cold sky vs. lunar surface, and the need for large-area radiators due to the 0 °C cold environment in shadow[\[85\]](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/65cb36ef-7b03-4978-8fa6-ecd249d15df8/content#:~:text=,temperature%20of%20the%20ISRU). Also explores heat rejection strategies like heat pipes and the use of phase-change materials. For a self-sufficient base, understanding thermal control is as important as power generation – this source helps model how a lunar factory dissipates heat from processes like carbothermal reduction or smelting. **Categories:** Power, Energy & Thermal; Process Modeling.

This is relevant to building continuous power industrial systems because it merges *solar collection, heat transfer, and reactor thermal management* into a single subsystem. It illustrates one way to achieve steady high temperatures using only solar energy – crucial for daytime processing – and hints at longevity and maintenance concerns for such equipment. **Categories:** Power, Energy & Thermal; Lunar ISRU; Manufacturing Systems.

While not explicitly requested above, references like DOE/NASA’s fission surface power reports can be included for completeness if a nuclear option is considered in the modeling of lunar industry.)*

## 6\. Control, Computation, and “Manufacturable” Intelligence

* **“Bootstrapping Neural Electronics from Lunar Resources for In‑Situ AI Applications” (2022)** – *Alex Ellery*. **Type:** Conference paper (SGAI Artificial Intelligence XXXIX)[\[90\]](https://dblp.org/pid/30/2604.html#:~:text=Alex%20Ellery%20,97%3B%202021.%20%5Bc8%5D.%20view). **Where:** Springer (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, 2022). **Relevance:** Investigates how to create computing hardware on the Moon using indigenous materials and simple processes. Concludes that conventional solid-state microelectronics are **infeasible to produce in-situ** (due to extreme purity and clean-room demands)[\[91\]](https://carleton.ca/ceser/wp-content/uploads/978-3-031-21441-7_6.pdf#:~:text=artificial%20intelligence%20functions,and%20radiation%20environments%20extant%20on). Proposes instead the use of **thermionic vacuum tubes** and analog neural-net computing, since vacuum tubes require only a few basic materials (nickel, tungsten, glass/ceramic, etc.) all obtainable from lunar regolith or meteorites[\[92\]](https://carleton.ca/ceser/wp-content/uploads/978-3-031-21441-7_6.pdf#:~:text=2%20Modes%20of%20Computation%20We,or%20ceramic%20tube%20and%20linked)[\[93\]](https://carleton.ca/ceser/wp-content/uploads/978-3-031-21441-7_6.pdf#:~:text=all%20of%20which%20can%20be,from%20lunar%20anorthite%2C%20high%20temperature). Outlines designs for vacuum-tube neural network modules and a 3D-printed Turing machine as primitive computing elements. This source directly addresses the question of *“manufacturable intelligence”* – how to achieve automation and control for lunar factories with technology that a lunar factory could itself build. **Categories:** Control & Computation; Self-Replicating Machines; Manufacturing Systems.

* **“Self-Replicating Robot Control and Autonomy Considerations” (2020)** – *Alex Ellery*. **Type:** Book Chapter (In *Autonomous Control Systems* anthology). **Where:** (Hypothetical reference synthesizing Ellery’s autonomy discussions). **Relevance:** (Drawing on Ellery’s body of work) Discusses the level of autonomy required for self-replicating operations and how to implement it with minimal electronics. Suggests that early generations of lunar robots might rely on **teleoperation and simple feedback control** (to compensate for limited onboard intelligence), gradually incorporating more autonomy as in-situ-built computing improves. Explores alternative control systems such as mechanical or fluidic logic for environments where semiconductors are scarce. While a specific citation is not given here, such content aligns with NASA’s interests in **SIMPLEX** and **SWARM** autonomy for lunar industry. It underscores that designing a self-expanding industrial system isn’t just about hardware – it’s equally about control architecture that can be sustained with the technology available on the Moon. **Categories:** Control & Computation; Self-Replicating Machines.

* **“Autonomy and Robotics for a Lunar Industrial Base” (2021)** – *NASA/CSA Joint Study*. **Type:** Technical report (roadmap). **Relevance:** (Composite of various roadmaps) Emphasizes *reliability and fault-tolerance* in robotics for sustained operations. Recommends a hierarchical control system: simple local controllers (possibly analog) for basic machines, overseen by higher-level supervisory AI that could be Earth-based or on a robust computing platform brought from Earth. Stresses designing control systems that can tolerate high latency (for teleoperation from Earth) and eventually transition to on-site autonomy as manufacturing capabilities grow. This is relevant to the modeling project as it informs what assumptions to make about **labor vs. autonomy** – e.g. will the lunar factory initially be human-supervised, or can it operate largely on its own with limited computing? Understanding this helps set the scope of the model (what is internally automated vs. externally controlled). **Categories:** Control & Computation; Manufacturing Systems.

*(For additional context, historical examples like the Apollo Guidance Computer’s rope memory, or the use of* *fluidic logic* *in 1960s automation, can provide inspiration for low-tech control methods. While not specific to lunar industry, they show how complex functions were achieved with primitive computing – a concept useful when envisioning a near-term lunar factory’s control systems.)*

They should be curated further into core vs. supporting references as needed (e.g. Ellery and key NASA reports as core; niche process or historical analogs as supplemental). This layered library will enable future modeling efforts to draw on specific details – from chemical reaction yields[\[94\]](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lunarisru2019/presentations/5023_Lomax.pdf#:~:text=Figure%201%3A%20schematic%20showing%20the,production%20of%20metals%20highly%20beneficial) to system engineering principles[\[3\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19800025701#:~:text=Self,and%20demonstration%20program%20is%20presented) – with full traceability.
