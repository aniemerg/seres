ABSTRACT
Self-replicating robots on the Moon require a lunar industrial ecology which by virtue of its recycling loops represents a sustainable approach to in-situ resource utilisation
(ISRU). However, the industrial ecology has only been
implemented piecemeal on Earth yet it is required to function as an integrated entity on the Moon. To that end, we
explore some approaches to manufacturing architectures
anticipating their application through the processing chain
from raw material mining through to chemical processing
to 3D printing of the self-replicating machine’s constituent
parts such as electric motors and electronics.

INTRODUCTION

Current plans to explore the Moon are destined to be unsustainable because sustainability is regarded as an addendum
rather than a central plank in lunar in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU). Sustainability is premised on ensuring that
future generations are not faced with a barren wasteland
through the reckless abandon of current generations. Implicit in this definition is the need to plan our ISRU practices over the long-term to ensure [1]: (a) we do not consume
and waste scarce resources; (b) we employ renewable technologies as far as is feasible; (c) we adopt processes that do
not yield toxic material; (d) we minimise waste through
recycling loops. To observe this, we need to design a longterm approach to lunar ISRU that adopts the philosophy of
indigenous peoples – exploit that which is abundant and
waste nothing. We must live off the land as much as possible to minimise our reliance on an Earth-based supply
chain. Rather than focusing on building specific products
from lunar material, we have adopted to build the means of
production; in the case of a self-replicating robot [2], this
constitutes a universal constructor that can build all its own
components – and all such components will serve general
utility. The self-replicating robot imposes severe sustainability constraints including a lunar industrial ecology supported by high energy return-on-investment (EROI). The
first step in defining our self-replicating robot is to determine our lunar resource availability in terms of required
resource functionality. Our demandite list incorporates all
the basic functional materials derived from lunar materials
required to construct mining robots, unit chemical processors, manufacturing robots and assembly robots.

All robotic machines comprise a specific configuration of
actuators controlled by a system of electronic logic. Hence,
we have selected two key components to be manufactured
from lunar material – electric motors for actuation and
vacuum tubes for computing machines (specifically, analogue neural network architectures). We have adopted 3D
printing as our universal manufacturing technique inspired
by the RepRap 3D printer [3]. We have demonstrated 3D
printing of a suite of electric motor parts. Vacuum tubes
also provide the basis for electrical energy generation
(thermionic conversion of Fresnel lens-based thermal energy) and while motors provide the basis for energy storage
(motorized flywheels). The former can potentially yield
high conversion efficiencies exceeding 30% sourced from
lunar materials [4]. These fundamental components define
the composition of the demandite list. From the demandite
list, the industrial ecology adopts a small number of chemical processing procedures with recycling loops in conjunction with 3D printing to minimise material wastage. This is
a perquisite for minimising energy consumption both contributing to sustainability. In conjunction with high energy
conversion efficiency, this suggests that energy return on
investment (EROI) can be attained, a condition of selfreplication - the self-replicating robot approach is essential
if ISRU is to be sustainable.

LUNAR INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY

The basic unit of the lunar industrial ecology is the unit
chemical processor. A chemical plant comprises a set of
large vessels for using chemical reactions to produce chemical products. Chemical processes are divided into steps
(unit operations) defined by a process that occurs within a
single reactor vessel. Unit operation is a basic analytical
approach in chemical processing – it involves a physical or
chemical transformation of a set of reagents into a set of
products, e.g. mixing, separation or distillation, cooling,
redox reactions, de(hydrogenation), (de)hydration reactions, (de)alkylation reactions, halogenation, ammoniation,
alkaline fusion, polymerization, etc. It typically involves
fluid flow, heat transfer and mass transfer resulting in
thermodynamic and mechanical processes. The vessels are
typically cylindrical with rounded ends suitable for high
pressures or vacuums. Each reactor comprises a unit operation defined with a quantified input feed and a quantified
output product. Within a single reactor, a unit operation
constitutes the chemical process which converts one com-

i-SAIRAS2020-Papers (2020)

pound (the input reagents) into another compound (the
output products). The chemical processes may be run in
continuous or batch mode – in either case, catalysts and
packed beds that have been poisoned by deposits may have
to be regenerated periodically. Mass transfer rate of fluids
through a reactor is defined through dimensionless numbers:
where
=Sherwood number,
=Reynolds number,
=Schmidt
number, C=empirical constant, k=mass transfer coefficient
(dimensions of velocity), A=cross sectional area,
L=characteristic length, D=mass diffusivity, v=fluid flow
velocity, =fluid dynamic viscosity and =fluid density.
The obvious way to increase mass flow rate is to increase
the pressure difference between the input and output ports
of the reactor. Material and energy balances must be analysed based on chemical analysis. This forms the basis of
the design of the controllers to regulate flows and monitor
temperatures, pressures, fluid flows, etc by controlling the
motorised pumps and valves. Note the centrality of motors.
Material composition management (MCM) is the core
problem in chemical and manufacturing processes [5].
Conservation of mass requires that all material entering the
chemical process either accumulates or exits the process as
product or waste (material balance). The reactants are injected into the reaction chamber within which the operating
conditions (temperature and pressure) determine the reaction progress. Furthermore, the reaction itself influences
those operating conditions which must be measured continuously. The reaction is also determined by the composition
of the reagents and their physical properties. The controller
must optimize the conditions and reagent flows to maximize the product yield whilst minimizing waste. Complexity
is introduced by chemical instabilities, uncertain and incomplete measurement data, limited predictive and diagnostic models, and time delays in chemical dynamics which
requires intelligent control with process monitoring based
on noisy data to deal with event-driven situations. An example of a single unit chemical processor is the Metalysis
FFC process reactor [6] that is central to the lunar industrial
ecology. Our lunar industrial ecology processes lunar minerals and volatiles into our demandite list. The most important lunar minerals for metal extraction include ilmenite
(Fe and Ti), anorthite (Al, Si and Ca) and orthoclase (K and
Si). The only material required from Earth is NaCl as a
recycled reagent of the ecosystem (it is not consumed). We
require Ni-Fe-Co meteoritic material available in lunar
craters from which these and other elements may be extracted through the carbonyl process. Lunar volatiles of
interest include hydrogen (from water), carbon compounds
and small amounts of nitrogen which can be extracted
thermally and fractionally condensed. The carbon provides
the basis for silicone plastic manufacture. The adoption of
mineral preprocessing with HCl acid permits the Metalysis
FFC process to reduce pure metal oxides into metal powder

with >99% purity. The CaCl2 electrolyte may be resupplied as a byproduct of metal extraction.
The lunar industrial ecology (Appendix 1) is an approach to
in-situ resource utilisation that is sustainable by linking
many different chemical processes together into an ecological system in which the waste of one process becomes the
feedstock for another. The lunar industrial ecology constitutes multiple unit chemical processors – this is unique to
the lunar environment as most terrestrial chemical processing systems involve only a small number of single
throughput processors. The lunar industrial ecology essentially constitutes a fan-in to a suite of 3D printing facilities
forming the core of a bow-tie configuration from which
manufactured products fan out [7,8]. We must now address
how our lunar ecology might be architected to operate in a
coordinated fashion to honour recycling loops between
processes with maximum efficiency. Lessons may be applied from the manufacturing factory into which the lunar
industrial ecology must be integrated. For example, a traditional functional factory layout arranges machines into
functional sections – milling, grinding, drilling, etc. Unfortunately, in such layouts, around 95% of total throughput
time is spent in transport or queuing for processing. A material flow network connecting modules of machines represents the most efficient production layout [9]. It combines
the adaptability of the distributed layout with high efficiency transport of compact layouts. Physical transport networks must adapt to local conditions. The Zipf inverse
distance law quantifies the volume of material N as inversely proportional to the distance D travelled:
.A
more sophisticated gravitational model that declares that
distance travelled is dependent on the strength of attraction
imposed by additional factors such a relief, obstacles, etc:
where pi=demand at location i
pj=demand at location j, dij=distance between locations i
and j, a=exponent of distance that determines the sharpness
of attraction, wi,j=weighting factors that quantify other
factors such as relief, obstacles, etc. This can be modelled
readily by a potential field representation to minimise distance for the transport of material.
An automated factory requires several functions: (i) product specification of complete product; (ii) production planner to schedule and coordinate manufacturing; (iii) parts
production – in this case through 3D printing technologies;
(iv) material handling and transport by mobile robots and
conveyors; (v) parts assembly by manipulators including
jigs; (vi) parts inspection by sensors through self-diagnosis;
(vii) computer coordination of the production process. An
example of an automated lights-out factory is the Fanuc
system of two-armed industrial robots equipped with vision
and force/torque sensors that assemble robots. The Fanuc
has not yet expanded throughout the manufacturing industry. Most industrial processes can be operated without hu-

man intervention, the human aspect being reserved primarily for setup, reprogramming and servicing. These can similarly be automated. Setup and servicing require sophisticated manual dexterity which is the preserve of manipulator
robotics which has applications to space debris mitigation
and on-orbit servicing [10,11]. The axiomatic approach to
manufacturing factory design flows down from its top-level
functional requirements to the design parameters. There are
two axioms of manufacturing [12-14]: (i) Maintain independence of a minimum number of functional requirements
of a product (independence axiom); (ii) Minimise information content (cost) of a product consistent with (i) (information axiom). This may be formalised as:
{FR}=[A]{DP} where FR=functional requirements vector,
DP=design parameters, A=design matrix=diagonal matrix
when axiom (i) is observed. A critical aspect is the decomposition of higher level system requirements (what) into
lower level components of that system to achieve the requirements (how) [15]. Effective design for manufacturing
can reduce manufacturing costs by 80% [16]. The methodology has subsequently been widened to design for manufacturing and assembly including logistics to minimise
production costs [17]. 3D printing is an approach that effectively minimises costs consistent with these principles and
indeed offers a more versatile mode of manufacture than
subtractive modes. It can also be legitimately be widened to
incorporate the (electro)chemical processing of raw materials and the mining chain, i.e. from raw material mining
through to final product – in the case of the self-replicating
system, this forms a closed loop. As a conjecture, it is conceivable that self-replication may introduce problems for
the axiomatic approach in a similar manner that Godel’s
theorems on self-reference introduced incompleteness
and/or inconsistency to axiomatic mathematics.

FLEXIBLE
(FMS)

MANUFACTURING

SYSTEMS

If a self-replicating machine serves only to replicate itself, a
relatively fixed throughput system would suffice for its
manufacture. A self-replicating system per se is of little
utility. Its power lies in its universal construction capabilities which require the ability to reconfigure itself with high
flexibility to adapt to manufacturing any other product –
this requires a flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) approach. FMS has been enabled by integration of computer
aided design (CAD), computer aided manufacturing
(CAM), computerised numerically controlled (CNC) machining and robots to collectively form computer integrated
manufacturing (CIM) systems [18,19]. CIM is the key element in FMS in which distributed workstations are linked
by computer-controlled material handling systems. Material
handling processes are an essential part of designing the
material flow structure in any distributed manufacturing
system. Automation implies a reduction (towards elimina-

tion) of human labour with higher throughput at higher
quality at lower cost. CIM includes CNC machines and
robots, production control through just-in-time manufacture, and transport vehicle control that are part of FMS. The
manufacturing cell with a highly automated compact footprint is the basic unit of FMS [20]. FMS comprise multiple
cells of robots, CNC machines and material handling linked
by a computer network to maximise its autonomous capabilities [21]. It is a multicell system interconnected by selfdriving transport vehicles on guide rails between cells. A
cellular manufacturing system is a type of FMS based
around groups of machines (cell) that are specialised for a
specific function [22,23]. Cellular manufacturing groups all
related activities together into a CNC machining centre
tended by a central robot to minimise human intervention.
A robot can select a workpiece and emplace it onto a conveyor to transport it to a CNC machine. Another robot
picks up the workpiece and emplaces it into the CNC machine. Finished parts are removed, emplaced onto another
conveyor and picked up by another robot for assembly with
other parts. A typical manufacturing cell includes five functions overseen by a centralised cell supervisor – manufacturing operations, machining planning, workpiece preparation, supplementary operations and inventory stocking [24].
The cell supervisor controls and co-ordinates machine
tools, robots, sequencing tasks, production processes, parts
and instigate quality control. In the automated lights-out
manufacturing system, the intelligent cell provides automated manufacturing, planning and stocking functions with
zero manual preparation and supplementary functions.
Only manufacturing operations add value to the workpiece
through the input of energy, information and material so all
other aspects of manufacture must be minimised. Traditionally, the cost of raw material is only a small fraction of
total product cost but for a self-replicating machine, the
capital costs of machinery are derived directly from the
constituent material costs. An FMS specification may be
transformed automatically into a coloured Petri net model
[25]. An FMS may be defined as a 7-tuple FMS={M, B, H,
Op, C, Mob, T} where M=set of machines, B=set of buffers, H=set of material handling systems, Op=set of operations for each machine, C=storage capacity for each buffer,
Mob=mobility of position range of handling system;
T=transportation capacity of handling system. This may be
transformed into a manufacturing model P={G,P} where
G=set of manufacturing processes, P=set of finished products. Cellular manufacturing reduces work-in-progress
allowing a just-in-time approach [26]. Deadlocks can occur
when two or more parts require the same resources at the
same time. This can invoke a freezing behaviour unless the
deadlock is resolved through detection and recovery methods.

i-SAIRAS2020-Papers (2020)

The manufacturing cell concept provides a balance between
flexibility and efficiency. Mass production maximises efficiency at the expense of flexibility while small lot production of complex systems requires high flexibility at a cost
of decreased efficiency. The need is to provide a balance
between these two factors which allows frequent redesign.
In the self-replicating machine, economies of scale are not
enabled through mass production but through exponential
production [27]. Universal construction requires the ability
to rapidly develop and manufacture new products with
quality, reliability and diversity in response to rapidly
changing market demands. FMS offer the advantages of
mass production with the flexibility of customisation.
Product variants can be accommodated readily from raw
materials to parts to assemblies. This flexibility has several
components – organisational flexibility to adapt to changes,
machine flexibility to implement different machining operations, material handling flexibility to move different part
types efficiently, operational flexibility to produce different
parts in different ways, process flexibility to maximise
parts types without major setup, product flexibility to create
new parts, routing flexibility to produce parts through alternate routes through the production process, volume flexibility to adjust output levels, expansion flexibility to adjust
capacity and capability as needed, program flexibility to
run autonomously for long periods, production flexibility to
manufacture a multitude of parts without new capital
equipment, and market flexibility to adapt to market changes [28]. Maximum flexibility implies the ability for rearrangement, change in materials and machining, machining
more complex geometries to increase the product range and
variation, and the ability to integrate new machining technologies – 3D printing offers these capabilities if it can be
proven that it can manufacture complex systems such as
robotic machines. These requirements are exactly those
required of a universal constructor which is a logical extension of the FMS which must be extended through the manufacturing chain from raw material mining through the
industrial ecology to the final product systems. Recently,
lean production has emphasised a reduction in inventory
stock (production to demand rather than stock for supply),
rational sequencing of operations and the elimination of
waste – indeed, the lunar industrial ecology implements
this through recycling. Lean manufacturing combines the
high-quality customisation of craft production with the high
quantity cheapness of mass production, a task to which 3D
printing is eminently suited. Examples of this include justin-time manufacturing (minimise excess inventory by
matching production rate to demand) and total quality management (minimise product waste through continuous quality control). Just-in-time manufacturing bears similarities to
generalised assembly line balancing along a conveyor to
consecutively distribute the total manufacturing workload
along the flow line. A variation of total quality manage-

ment is 6 sigma quality which aims to reduce tolerance
deviance beyond the traditional 3 sigma levels at every
stage of the production process. All are effectively concerned with the minimisation of waste.

MANUFACTURING ARCHITECTURES

Control architectures in manufacturing have evolved from
centralised hierarchies into distributed heterarchies [29].
Centralised architectures offer complete global control
effort but are slow to respond to perturbations due to high
overheads. This may be modified into a top-down hierarchy
which overcomes the overhead problem through task decomposition but the response problem remains. The hierarchy is the most traditional organisational form with its treelike structure where fewer higher agents have more global
views than more numerous lower agents in the hierarchy.
Complex systems often form hierarchies of interrelated
subsystems in which the interactions between subsystems
are suppressed with respect to those within subsystems –
they are nearly decomposable such that subsystems can be
treated as if they are almost independent of each other. This
is the principle of decomposition of increasing precision
with decreasing intelligence [30]. An example applied to
FMS is a three-layer hierarchy of an organisation level for
scheduling integrated sets of machines (factory level), coordination level for coordinating machines (cell or job shop
level) and execution level for controlling each machine task
(machine level) [31]. The hierarchy may or may not have
same level interactions through internal links. Hierarchies
implement a divide-and-conquer strategy but are brittle.
Hierarchies may be modified by allowing some same level
interactions in a more distributed approach. The heterarchical architecture is a flexible distributed multi-agent approach to problem solving in which no single agent has a
global view of the problem, only a partial view. Blackboards such as the NASREM architecture are of this nature
[32]. The heterarchical structure is flat characterised by
entirely same level interactions in a distributed fashion
without any central or global control. Decentralised control
with localised intelligence linked with adaptive communications will be essential. In biological systems, distributed
control of modules operating on the basis of local information only without centralized arbitration is ubiquitous.
As long as communications exist between these subunits,
coordination through a higher level self-organised centralised controller is possible [33]. Fully autonomous mining
and manufacturing will require self-learning and selfoptimisation to adapt flexibly and rapidly to a variable
demand environment, i.e. reconfigurability is essential [34].
There are certain design principles required for reconfigurability that goes beyond traditional flexible manufacturing
systems (FMS) [35]. They are based on flexibility, convertibility, scalability and modularity and the key element is the

i-SAIRAS2020-Papers (2020)

implementation of actuators for multiple degrees of freedom. The distributed heterarchy is highly fault tolerant to
perturbations but is difficult to predict. Decentralised approaches may be combined with supervisory control.
Complex multi-agent manufacturing systems may be configured several different ways. The object-oriented paradigm has given way to agent-based design. Agent-based
systems are ideally suited to distributed architectures.
Agents are a development of this concept involving autonomous well-defined entities with well-defined boundaries
and interfaces [36]. Agents are objects in the objectoriented paradigm – it comprises a set of tasks which interact through message passing. However, whereas objectoriented approaches are built around passive objects, agentbased approaches place emphasis on active agent interactions. Swarm-based approaches using multiple agents with
simple local behaviours to generate complex behaviours is
the most robust approach to multi-robot coordination.
Agent-based distributed architectures comprise a set of
agents – cooperating autonomous entities that can selforganise into a population without any global controller.
Each agent has knowledge for its task; each agent has an
interface to interact with other agents and/or the environment; each agent is hierarchically constructed. There are
many applications of agent-based computing [37]. CORBA
(common object request broker architecture) is an industrial
middleware agent-based protocol applied to an intelligent
machine cell to coordinate its subsystems [38]. An open
systems architecture can partition the FMS into autonomous entities (modules) that communicate and coordinate
with each other [39]. Agents must learn from their environments to adapt - with multiple agents, this is complex
requiring mechanisms of coordination. There are several
market-based approaches to multi-agent mechanisms [40].
The bucket brigade algorithm optimises work allocation
between resources to maintain load balance without supervision. The contract net protocol is a market-based technique that involves agents competing for subtasks through
the submission of bids [41]. However, optimisation-based
allocation of tasks among agents is superior to marketbased approaches in multi-robot task allocation [42,43].
Optimisation generally implies linear programming with
respect to utility, fitness value or resource cost of a task
[44]. The evolutionary algorithm is an optimisation procedure that is suited to manufacturing schedules [47]. Similarly, it has been proposed that an information-theoretic
measure – generalised correlation entropy - of spatiotemporal coordination of multiple modules of a distributed
robotic system be employed as the fitness function of a
genetic algorithm to evolve the system [46]. Selforganisation can be applied to multi-agent manufacturing in
which multiple agents form a society of agents to solve
problems beyond any individual agent’s capacity [47].

5006.pdf

Agents have only local interactions and interact with each
other through a coordination model. Local interactions
between components result in emergent global properties
without any central control or supervision. For selforganisation, a critical threshold must be exceeded for the
emergence of global order to occur. It is the multiplicity of
short-range interactions that yield complex “emergent”
global behaviours that are not reducible to the behaviour of
its parts. The commonest example is the collective behaviours of insect colonies of ants, termites, bees and wasps.
The ant colony is a self-organising system in which
stigmergy provides the mechanism for implicit rather than
explicit coordination [48]. Each ant observes cues from its
environment independently to invoke simple behaviours
individually. By depositing pheromones, some fluctuations
grow while others fade. These accumulating pheromones
drive individual agents that appear coordinated. Communication between insects is indirect and mediated through the
environment – stigmergy. Individual insects mark their
environment using volatile chemicals – pheromones –
which collectively coordinate them. Ants modify their environment by depositing pheromones locally and the pheromones propagate spatially as a global dissipation field. It is
these local modifications that communication to other foraging ants. A specific sign in the environment triggers specific actions by the agents. This can be directly applicable
to ant agents in a mine, processing and manufacturing environment. Life is a complex system in that it is characterised
by multiply interacting agents which themselves may be
simple with nonlinear interactions subject to simple shortrange laws. Biological complex systems operate far-fromequilibrium and open to external energy and information
with a self-organised hierarchical internal structure with
internal feedback loops. Emergent global properties have
their own causal rules irreducible to component causal
effects.
Reconfigurability reduces the complexity and cost of FMS
by adaptively matching capacity to need [49,50]. Reconfigurable manufacturing systems are designed to accommodate rapid changes in manufacturing architecture in response to new demands in productive function. They minimise unused capacity but can adjust rapidly to new demands [51]. This rapid response to changing demands is the
hallmark of agile manufacturing (itself similar to lean manufacturing except that agile manufacturing is proactive
while lean manufacturing is reactive) [52,53]. Reconfigurable systems are distinct from FMS in that they are rapid but
limited in flexibility to part diversity whereas FMS has
maximum flexibility in part range. We need both. There are
six principles of reconfigurability: (i) modularity; (ii) integrability of interfaces; (iii) customised flexibility; (iv)
scalability of factory; (v) convertibility of factory to different production requirements; (vi) diagnosability of abnor-

i-SAIRAS2020-Papers (2020)

mal behaviour [54,55]. Modules can be reconfigured rapidly into an integrated system which can be readily modified
with new modules to adjust both product and capacity.
Modular design of products permits agile manufacturing by
configuring modules into different products, the configurations of which can be searched using tabu search [56]. Tabu
search is suitable for solving NP-hard problems by starting
from an initially feasible solution to search for better solutions subject to minimum cost. Genetic programming also
may be employed to evolve the self-organisation of parts
into a final self-assembly [57]. The genetic program has a
hierarchical structure with components for assembly that
can be randomly selected subject to assembly constraints
defined by fitness. Reconfigurable manufacturing allows
ready flexibility to perturbations that can affect throughput
without re-design of the manufacturing plant. Many reconfigurable systems employ material transport systems such
as gantries and conveyors that form the backbone of the
system with an emphasis on CNC machining. The flows of
service or goods in such a transport network are controlled
by demand and supply in a market economy system forming a network topology. The volume of service or goods
through the transport network may be quantified by
Kirchoff’s circuit laws. Petri nets may also be used to model concurrent manufacturing activities as noted earlier.
There are several types of reconfigurable manufacturing
architecture in providing dynamic flexibility of distributed
cells – fractal, holonic and bionic [58]. The units in each
case are slightly different. The fractal manufacturing architecture is a reconfigurable system whose chief characteristic is that its autonomous agents are self-similar and reconfigurable and these agents cooperate through message passing to solve problems [59,60]. They are self-similar at all
levels of their hierarchy, the configuration of which is controlled by a system agent. It can autonomously selforganise its organisational structure (but not its physical
structure) in response to a dynamic environment through
reinforcement learning [61]. Reinforcement learning lies
between the exact feedback of supervised learning and the
lack of feedback of unsupervised learning. It is unclear how
the fractal architecture might be implemented practically.
The holonic architecture is the most popular agent-based
approach to manufacturing systems control as it combines
hierarchical and heterarchical architectures [62]. The holonic system has been adopted in automotive factories
based on Arthur Koestler’s concepts on the material basis
of mind-brain duality in his “Ghost in the Machine” (1967)
[63]. Biological cells are comprised of organelles while
also being part of tissues (holonic architecture). Inspired by
organelles of the biological cell, the holonic factory model
comprises a hierarchy of tissue holons comprised of multiple cell holons. Each cell holon comprises a nucleus holon
(for decision-making), a golgi complex holon (for invento-

5006.pdf

ry), a lysosome holon (for reprocessing and recycling), an
endoplasmic reticulum holon (for transport) and ribosome
holons (for production) in which mRNA act as a messaging
system and tRNA as a negotiation system. The holarchy is
a system of holons that permits a heterarchical system implement a nested hierarchical structure to provide conflict
resolution with the holon representing a hybrid character of
both whole and part [64]. A holon is simultaneously both a
subordinate agent comprised of parts from a lower level
and part of a larger superordinate agent. The holonic architecture self-regulates in response to perturbations from the
environment modelled as a social system [65]. It is based
on cooperating holons forming an integrative holarchy
based on functional decomposition. The holarchy combines
the static stability of the hierarchy with the dynamic flexibility of the heterarchy through the dual nature of the holon
[66]. The holon is an autonomous, self-contained, selfregulating module yet it is part of higher order holons and
itself is comprised of lower order holons, smearing the
difference between part and whole, i.e. holons may be aggregated (exhibiting emergent complex behaviours from
interactive simple behaviours) or specialised (exhibiting the
inheritance of agents). The holarchy comprises different
sets of alliances – short-lived coalitions, task-oriented
teams, long-lived congregations, long-lived societies governed by social laws, loosely bound federations. Holons
interact through broadcast messaging and contract net protocol. Metamorphic control of holonic systems is an approach for real time operation [67]. The holarchy can be
augmented with stigmergy to enhance clustering through
self-organisation [68]. Stigmergy is a bio-inspired approach
that implements communication between components
through modification of the local environment.
PROSA (product-resource-order-staff architecture) is an
agent-based holonic manufacturing reference architecture
based on four types of holonic agents [69,70]: (i) order
holons (agents for workpiece tasking, logistics and its control and timing); (ii) product holons (agents for product
functionality such as process planning and quality assurance); (iii) resource holons (agents for physical and information resource handling such as machine or factory); and
(iv) staff holons (agents for global centralised supervision).
Software agents acting as virtual ants coordinate between
physical agents so they can aggregate multiple agents to
form holonic systems. PROSA has a self-similarity aspect
incorporating a fractal architecture. An example of an holonic system is the plug-and-produce software reconfiguration facility of an holonic robot assembly system comprising three manipulators, one belt conveyor and two warehouses [71,72]. Stigmergy has been demonstrated within
the context of PROSA as an indirect mechanism of coordination in multi-agent holonic manufacturing system [73,74]
in which PROSA agents were coordinated for adaptability

to changes in the environment. Termite-inspired robots
using only very simple behavioural rules could build structures from magnetically-connected bricks through emergence. PROSA may be extended ontologically into the
bionic architecture based on a hierarchy of biological cell
analogues (modelons) including the possibility of biological morphogenesis. A cell may be differentiated into different functions but all are based on the same underlying architecture.

hierarchical neural control under nominal conditions but
switches to hormone regulation for agile adaptation under
off-nominal conditions with a reorganisation of resources.
Hormonal secretion quantity is given by [79]

The Biological Manufacturing Systems is a bio-inspired
approach to manufacturing for coping with internal and
external environmental perturbations during the product
lifecycle. In this paradigm, manufacturing machines breed
products in which potential fields attract dynamically jobs
to machines [75]. A classifier system with if-then production rules with bucket brigade credit assignment was adopted to implement genetic learning [76]. Genetic algorithms
have also been applied to finding a minimum cost machine
layout for a factory floor based on interaction forces between different manufacturing activities [77]. A neuroendocrine-inspired manufacturing system (NEIMS) emulates
the biological neurocontrol-hormonal regulation system
and its characteristic adaptability [78]. The endocrine system releases hormone signalling molecules through the
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis to the bloodstream in
response to neural stimulus – hypothalamic neurons stimulate pituitary CRH (ACTH-releasing hormone) to stimulate
adrenal ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) synthesis
which in turn stimulates biosynthesis of cortisol which
inhibits CRH/ACTH production. The nervous system implements adaptive control while the endocrine system im-

dependent cost for task, t=duration of job, λ=control parameter. This latter is particularly analogous to the lunar
industrial ecology of chemical processors.
CONCLUSIONS

Our lunar industrial ecology represents a sustainable approach to ISRU which feeds into a manufacturing system
based on 3D printing to constitute a self-replicating machine. Although multiple machines that must be coordinated are characteristic of manufacturing, this is not so in
chemical processing plants. The lunar industrial ecology
however involves multiple chemical processors that must
be coordinated with extensive recycling loops. The design
and architecture of manufacturing factories may be applied
to the lunar industrial ecology and these approaches have
been reviewed. Although these approaches are appropriate
throughout the processing chain from mining to final product, a central facet of any ISRU system will involve exploration of the planetary environment and acquire physical
resources [80]. This will require complex strategies involving coordination of multiple roving robots.
