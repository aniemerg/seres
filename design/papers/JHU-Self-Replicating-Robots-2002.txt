Motivation
Space is a potentially limitless source of materials and energy that is available for mankind's use.
Unfortunately, the launch costs and environmental impact of directly sending significant numbers of
humans and massive structures into outer space are prohibitive. The development of lunar resources has the
potential to change this relatively grim picture. If significant portions of the lunar surface can be used for
solar energy collection, and it's regolith can be effectively strip-mined and processed, then the resulting
energy and materials can be transported to low-earth orbit or elsewhere in the solar system at relatively low
energetic cost. This circumvents much of the energetic cost of transporting massive amounts of materials
from the Earth's surface, and saves the Earth's atmosphere from the pollution resulting from unnecessary
launches. The key to unlocking space resources is the autonomous development of the moon using selfreplicating robotic systems that propagate over the lunar surface.
When self-replicating robotic factories take hold, the moon will be transformed into an industrial
dynamo. The resulting refined materials and energy that will be produced on the moon will then provide
capabilities for the exploration and colonization of space that could never exist otherwise. Equipped with
refined materials and propellant derived from the moon, cultivation of other space resources will be made
much easier.
The concept of artificial self-replicating systems originated with John von Neumann in the 1950's in
his theory of automata. His theoretical concepts built on those of Alan Turing's “universal computer” put
forth in the 1930s. The main difference was that instead of being able to read and write data, a selfreplicating system reads instructions and converts these into assembly commands that result in the
assembly of replicas of the original machine. The history of these ideas is discussed in [1], along with other
efforts at self-replication. The vast majority of work in this area is in the form of non-physical selfreplicating automata (e.g., computer viruses, the “game of life'' computer program, etc.). The only
physically-realized concepts that have been explored related to true physical self-replication pertain to selfassembling systems [2 - 4]. These interesting systems are collections of passive elements that self-assemble
under external agitation or naturally occurring physical forces. There is no directed intention of a system to
deterministically assemble a copy of itself from passive components in these physical systems, and the
structures that are assembled are themselves passive. Notable concept papers on self-replicating system for
space applications were put forth in the late 1970's and early 1980's [5, 6]. They proposed self-replicating
factories that would weight 100 tons each, but gave no concrete architecture, system or prototype to
demonstrate the feasibility of the concept.
Our study is motivated by these conceptual studies. However, it is important to note that to our
knowledge no physically realized self-replicating robotic system has ever been built by anyone else, and to
do so is one of the contributions of our research. Our vision of the central role of self-replicating robotic
factories in the development of outer space is illustrated in Figure 1.
We have taken a two-pronged approach to studying self-replicating robotic systems. On the one hand,
we have begun to develop robotic hardware capable of demonstrating remote controlled and autonomous
self-replication in a highly structured laboratory setting. An example of our initial results is presented in the
last part of Section 2. On the other hand, we have performed an analysis of how self-replicating factory
systems would propagate over the lunar surface. This is summarized in Section 3. For more details of both
aspects of our studies see [7, 8].

2. Principle of Self-Replicating Robots
In this section self-replicating robots are categorized into two primary divisions according to their behavior.
The two divisions are denoted as “directly replicating” and “indirectly replicating,” respectively. The
detailed principles of these two divisions are described below. Figure 2 illustrates a diagram of how we
categorize self-replicating robots.
Basically, a robot capable of producing an exact replica of itself in one generation is what we call
“directly replicating”. A robot capable of producing one or more intermediate robots that are in turn
capable of producing replicas of the original are called “indirectly replicating”.
2.1 Directly Replicating Robots
We classify self-replicating robots in this division into four groups according to the characteristics of their
self-replication processes. The following are explanations of each self-replicating robot group.
2.1.1Fixture-Based Group
The self-replicating robots in this group depend on external fixtures in order to complete the self-replication
process. Passive fixtures are able to assist in this because of the shape constraints that they impose. In some
other cases, to unify subsystems, push-pull fixtures are helpful as well.
2.1.2 Operating-Subsystem-in-Process Group
In this group one or several subsystems of the replica can operate before the replica itself is fully
assembled. These subsystems are able to assist the original self-replicating robot during the assembly of the
replica.
2.1.3 Single-Robot-Without-Fixture Group
In this group only one robot is used to finish the self-replication process. Thus, the robot in this group
depends only on the available environment. Usually, the complexity of the subsystems or the number of
subsystems in the replica is very low for this group.
2.1.4 Multi-Robot-Without-Fixture Group
In this group more than one robot works together in the self-replication process without the assistance of
fixtures. A major advantage is the reduction of the time required for self-replication. A disadvantage is that
there may be interference problems among robots.
There are several possible ways that a self-replicating robot can be categorized in two or three groups
mentioned above. The combination of two or three different concepts can be incorporated in a potential
design, such as a combining operating-subsystems-in-process with fixture-based robots. More categories
are likely to be developed in the subsequent stages of our research in the area of self-replicating robots.

2.2 Indirectly Replicating Robots
The primary characteristic of the robots in this division is that the original robot or group of robots works
together to build a robot-producing factory or some type of intermediate robot which is able to produce
replicas of the original robot. However, the original robots lack the ability to directly assemble copies of
themselves.

A number of prototype robots is implemented by using Lego Mindstorm Kits and additional Lego
parts. One example of a prototype robot is shown in Figure 3.
3. The Proliferation of Self-Replicating Robots on the Moon
Because of its significant impact on the utilization of space, we studied the proliferation of self-replicating
robots on the surface of the moon. In our model, each self-replicating robotic factory consists of robots,
materials processing capabilities, solar energy production, and electromagnetic railguns for transporation of
replicas and materials to new locations. The proliferation process is modeled as a degenerated diffusion that
evolves on the rotation group SO(3). By measuring distance in units of lunar radius, the moon is
approximated as a unit sphere, and the equation that describes the proliferation of self-replicating robotic
systems over the surface of the moon is then [7]:

where f(α,β,γ;t) is a probability density function with α, β and γ denoting the ZYZ Euler angles
respectively, d1 is the drift coefficient denoting the shooting distance per shot of the railgun, D11 the
diffusion coefficient denoting the shooting distance error per shot in the shooting direction, D33 the
diffusion coefficient denoting the angular shooting error per shot perpendicular to the shooting direction in
the plane tangent to the lunar surface, and the time t is normalized so that t=1 corresponds to one shot. Here

Figure 3 (b): The Self-Replicating Process of the Robot 1. Robot 1 consists of five subsystems. Two fixtures are used: a ramp with
constrained shape which is fitted to the controller and the connector; and a tunnel-like cave with an attached wedge on the ceiling used
to physically force the connector in place. The process begins with the original robot dragging the right part (which consists of half of
the chassis, the right wheel and the right motor) to a wall. Then the left part (which consists of half of the chassis, the left wheel and
the left motor) is pushed to connect with this right part. The left and right parts of the replica are securely merged by adding the
bumper which has interlocks to both subsystems. The combined subsystems are moved and oriented to a desired position and
orientation next to the ramp. The original robot then pushes the controller up to the ramp, and gently drops and inserts the controller
on the top of the previous combination of subsystems. The connector is fixed in its place in the same fashion. The last step is to
physically force the connector to be in contact with the controller by pushing the replica in the tunnel-like area with a wedge on the
ceiling. This will force the connector to be in place. After pushing the replica several times, the electronic connectors on the replica
finally make contact. The replica is able to operate in the same way as the original does.

concentrated at the initial landing site. To study the time evolution of the probability distribution, we

which denotes the evolution of position of self-replicating robots on the surface of the moon without regard
to railgun orientation. The variables α and β serves as spherical coordinates. The following figure reflects
the general process of the proliferation of self-replicating robots on the moon.

4. Conclusions
Space is a domain of unlimited resources. Unfortunately, the cost of reaching space is very high. Selfreplicating autonomous factories will be vital if man is to exploit space resources. Self-replicating robotic
systems are a necessary ingredient for self-replicating robotic factories to become a reality.
