This paper introduces the concept of a physical selfreplicating machine for deployment on the Moon
utilizing raw material available on the Moon. A detailed
but selective review is given in order to highlight clearly
the novel aspects of this concept. In particular, it is
hypothesized that if electric motors and vacuum tubes
can be 3D printed from the limited repertoire of lunar
materials, 3D printing constitutes a universal
construction mechanism. This follows from the
observation that mechatronic components are the
constituent parts of all robotic mechanisms. In particular,
we examine the use of 3D printing of electronics as a
physical instantiation of a Turing machine. Several
general implications of such a self-replicator are
considered including whether it constitutes artificial life
and mitigation against runaway replication.

Introduction
This paper is concerned with the physical
implementation of a self-replicating machine (Freitas
and Merkle, 2004). We are concerned with a macroscale
self-replicating machine rather than nanoscale selfreplicators typified by molecular assemblers. Our goal is
to develop a self-replicating factory complex that can be
programmed to manufacture solar power satellites in
large quantities on the Moon to provide a scalable power
source for Earth’s future energy needs (Ellery 2016a).
The lunar self-replicating machine is described but
special consideration is given to the manufacture of
electric motors and vacuum tubes as essential
mechatronic components for self-replication. 3D
printing is introduced as a mechanism of universal
construction but also of universal computing. The 3D
printer, in printing neural electronics represents a
physical instantiation of the universal Turing machine.
A contextual review then follows concluded with a
consideration of more general implications with respect
to artificial life and unrestrained replication.

A Lunar Self-Replicating Machine
The key concept in self-replication is the universal
constructor generalizing on the universal Turing
machine encapsulating the notion of computing (Burks

and von Neumann, 1966). Critical to universal
construction is parts closure – this has three aspects,
namely, matter, energy and information closure, though
material closure is our primary concern here – any
deviation from material closure invokes the necessity to
import material from Earth which should be minimized.
Closure requires restriction of both the materials
inventory required (and so the number of extractive
processes) and the families of components (and so the
number of manufacturing processes). To minimize the
materials requirement is to base the self-replicating
machine on a restricted suite of readily available
materials in the lunar regolith. The core of this materials
inventory is iron (and a number of its alloys). The
forthcoming lunar Resource Prospector (RP) mission
will be demonstrating a number of relevant technologies
for the extraction of raw material on the Moon (George
et al, 2012). The RP mission is a 10 day lunar surface
mission to the Cabeus crater near the lunar south-pole
where water ice has been detected by the LCROSS
satellite. It comprises a lunar rover carrying the 72 kg
RESOLVE (regolith and environment science and
oxygen and lunar volatile extraction) payload to
demonstrate in-situ resource utilization of lunar
material. It includes a drill to acquire core samples of
lunar regolith to a depth of 1m, a reactor to heat samples
to 150oC to evolve water and other gases and then to
900oC to extract oxygen (O2), pure iron (Fe) and titania
(TiO2) from ilmenite (FeTiO3) via hydrogen reduction.
The rest of the RESOLVE payload is instrumentation –
neutron spectrometer to detect subsurface hydrogen
(water) during the rover traverse and a near infrared
spectrometer to detect evolved volatiles from the heated
samples. From the carbon-based volatiles and lunar
silicate minerals, silicone plastics may be manufactured
using traditional techniques. The manufacture of a range
of iron alloys – wrought iron, steels (such as tool steel
and silicon steel), fernico and permalloy require access
to silicon (from silicate minerals), nickel, cobalt and
tungsten. Access to tunico (tungsten, nickel and cobalt)
elements requires subsurface mining at mascon (mass
concentration) locations where subsurface nickel-iron
meteorite materials are buried. There are two major
mining approaches that may be considered. Room and
pillar mining involves excavating subsurface materials

Fig 1. Iron-impregnated PLA-based electric motor
In particular, we have been concentrating on 3D printing
the magnetic core of the motor as the most fundamental
basis of both rotor (in dc motors) and stator (in ac
motors). Magnetic core electromagnets can also
substitute for permanent magnets. We are experimenting
with photolithographically printed coils in different
configurations (currently implemented in a pancake
concept for testing – Fig 2) which will be incorporated
into the rotor concept.

Fig 2. Photolithographically-printed coils
A 3D printed electromagnet-based stator will essentially
complete the 3D printed motor. Currently, our 3D
printed stator electromagnets constructed from ironimpregnated PLA generate insufficient magnetic field
intensity even with 200 windings (Fig 3) – we are
redressing this by employing SLS-printed magnetic steel
for the stator.

to form rooms supported by pillars. This leaves large
blocks of ore in the pillars. Longwall mining involves
tunneling with a shearer to cut the ore face. The tunnel
is supported by roof supports. A series of conveyor belts
return the ore to the surface. These approaches are
highly energy intensive whereas drilling would reduce
the amount of overburden removed (Ellery, 2016b).
Once raw materials have been extracted, they must be
fashioned into parts and components. The use of 3D
printing alleviates the parts closure problem by
simultaneously addressing both parts and manufacturing
diversity. RepRap uses fused deposition modelling
((FDM) to manufacture many of its own plastic
components (Jones et al, 2011). This first step towards a
self-replicating machine requires several extensions to
become a fully self-replicating machine: (i) 3D printing
metal parts; (ii) 3D printing electric motors; (iii) 3D
printing electronics including computers; (iv) selfassembly. There are seven major types of 3D printing
technologies but we are concerned with only four: (i)
fused deposition modelling (FDM) of molten plastic; (ii)
selective laser sintering/melting (SLS/SLM) fuses
powder of metal, plastic or ceramic using lasers; (iii)
electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF3) sinters/melts
metal rod only using an electron beam; (iv) binder
jetting involves layers of polymeric binder to ceramic,
metal or plastic particles. Powder bed methods such as
SLS/SLM are generally disallowed in micro-gravity or
vacuum environments due to powder dispersion and
vacuum welding of the powder respectively. This leaves
FDM for plastic, EBF3 for metal and binder jetting for a
variety of materials. We have had some successes in
developing 3D printing of electric motors using FDM of
iron particle-impregnated PLA plastic (Fig 1):

Fig 3. Rotor with proposed stator configuration
We have yet to demonstrate 3D printing of electronics
though we have demonstrated the viability of our
approach. For computing circuitry, solid state transistors
are infeasible for lunar manufacture due to their
complex fabrication procedures involving extreme
conditions and reagents. Although simple RC filter
circuits can be inkjet printed in polymer (Chen et al,
2003), plastic electronics is not well developed. We
have been exploring 3D printing multiple materials with
regard to melting temperature compatibility. Silicone
plastic has operational thermal tolerance up to 300oC but
we have found that it can tolerate much higher
temperatures for short periods. We have lain molten ZnAl (ZA8) alloy (melting temperature of 375-404oC) onto
a silicone plastic substrate to emulate a metal 3D
printing process (Fig 4). We laid an Al alloy wire track
onto the silicone substrate as a first step towards 3D
printing metal circuitry. In addition, we demonstrated
melting of 3004/3105 aluminium alloy using a 1.5 m x
1.5 m Fresnel lens to emulate the use of lunar solar
concentrators.

Fig 4. Aluminium track on silicone plastic substrate
We have adopted vacuum tubes as an alternative to
transistors without their inherent fabrication complexity.
Vacuum tubes are more efficient and versatile than
electromagnetic relays that have in fact been 3D-printed
(Malone and Lipson, 2007). Rather than adopting
traditional general von Neumann computer architectures
which impose large physical footprints, we have
adopted an analogue neural net circuit based on a
modified Yamashida-Nakaruma design (Yamashida &
Nakaruma, 2007) (Fig 4):

Neural network hidden node footprint grows only
logarithmically with task complexity (Parberry, 1994)
and recurrent neural networks have been proven to be
Turing-complete (Siegelmann and Sontag, 1995),
perhaps even offering super-Turing capabilities
(Cabessa and Seigelmann, 2012). A universal Turing
machine comprises an infinitely long tape which stores a
program and its input data which after the computation
is replaced by the program’s output data. The tape is
scanned by a reading head which moves backward and
forward reading and manipulating each symbol in turn
according to the program and then writes the output onto
the tape. It is envisaged in our 3D printer setup that
programs are stored in magnetic core memory (with a
similar material configuration as magnetic cores of
electric motors) which constitutes the input tape to a
Turing machine represented by a 3D printer-type device.
The output is a physically 3D printed neural network
circuit for the specific task. Different neural circuit
configurations correspond to different programs stored
in magnetic core memory. The complete system is a
universal Turing machine but the printed output circuits
represent specific programs. They may be fine-tuned
through an electrical circuit representation of the
backpropagation algorithm (Martinelli and Perfetti,
1991; Larson and Ellery, 2015).
If electric motors and vacuum tubes can be 3D printed
using materials extractable from lunar resources (Table
1), all these tasks would be achievable, thereby
demonstrating that 3D printing would constitute a
universal construction mechanism (Ellery, 2016c).

W/m2 (or equivalently, 1 MW requires under 90 m x 90
m solar concentrator (nominally, Fresnel lenses) area.
Vacuum tube technology is also the basis of the klystron
and magnetron for high-power microwave generation
required for solar power satellites (Ellery, 2016d).
Vacuum tubes are highly reliable and durable when
maintained at constant temperature at the power-on
state. This suggests that significant steps towards parts
closure can be achieved by utilizing components for
multiple purposes such as magnetic cores and vacuum
tubes.

Machines

Water
Gases
Oxygen – hydrogen
Table 1. Lunar material inventory
There are three major resource repositories on the
Moon: (i) the ubiquitous regolith; (ii) adsorbed volatiles
in the regolith; (iii) asteroidal material. Initial recovery
of raw material from the Moon is simple using bucket
wheels followed by electrostatic and magnetic
beneficiation. We envisage a number of basic chemical
processes to extract 3D printer feedstock:
(i)
Extraction of lunar volatiles for the
production of fuel/propellant and silicone
plastics/oils
(ii)
Extraction of iron alloys for structure and
electric motors
(iii)
Extraction of Al metal for structure and
electrical wiring
(iv)
Extraction of Si and SiO2 for alloying,
ceramics and silicones
We outline just one or two representative extractive
processes here. Solar wind has impregnated regolith
with 96% hydrogen (~120 ppm), almost 4% He and
trace amounts of H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, N2, NH3, H2S,
SO2 and the noble gas Ar. Heating the regolith to 700oC
would release 90% of these adsorbed volatiles. Silicone
plastics (siloxanes) can be manufactured from syngas
providing superior resistance to radiation and thermal
extremes while minimising carbon consumption in
comparison with hydrocarbon plastics. Further heating
regolith to 900-1050oC permits hydrogen thermoreduction of ilmenite:
FeTiO3 + H2 → Fe + TiO2 + H2O
H2O → H2 + ½O2
Further heating to 1600oC allows molten iron to be bled
off. From asteroidal material, Ni, Co, W and Se are
extractable for diverse alloy creation. Ceramics present a
challenge for 3D printing due to the high temperatures
required for sintering or melting. To 3D print ceramics,
plastic pre-ceramic resins can be 3D printed as plastic
gel into structures which are then fired into a high
temperature ceramic. One possible mechanism that we
have yet to explore is to employ silicone plastics as
precursors to ceramics. Silicone may be converted to
silica by flame combustion in oxygen:
SiOxCy + (1-x+2y)O2 →SiO2 +yCO2
This provides a mechanism for 3D printing ceramics
without involving extreme temperatures of direct
sintering while the CO2 is recovered (thereby conserving
carbon resources). From silica, quartz may be
crystallised (as a piezoelectric sensor material)
Actuators-controllers-sensors constitute the key
components for any robotic mechanisms (including 3D
printers which are effectively Cartesian robots) so are
central to any self-replicating machine. Furthermore,
these two components – electric motors and vacuum
tubes - provide the basis for energy generation (through
thermionic emission) and energy storage (through
motorized flywheels). Assuming 10% efficiency, solar
energy provides an electrical energy density of 130

We present a contextual but selective review of selfreplication to illustrate that this work goes far beyond
the architectural considerations of past work by
attempting to physically realise key components of a
self-replicator. The first model of a self-replicating
machine is the von Neumann kinematic self-replicating
machine (Burks and von Neumann, 1966). It comprised
a manipulator (constructing) arm controlled by a
separate program of step-by-step procedures stored on a
memory tape that instructed the arm to pick components
from a sea of component parts and assemble a copy of
itself. The copying of a separate description of the selfreplicator on the tape avoids the problem of selfreference and infinite regress. The self-replicator
comprises four major subsystems that have their
biological counterparts (Mange and Sipper, 1998):
component A comprises a universal constructor
including a construction arm (equating to a ribosome);
component B (A + C + D) comprises a tape of
instructions describing the specifications of the machine
(equating to a genetic code); component C comprises a
controller that reads the tape B and passes the
interpreted information to constructor A (equating to
repressor and inducer proteins); component D comprises
a tape copier to copy B (equating to RNA and DNA
polymerase). The composition of B, C and D constitute
a universal Turing machine that holds a set of
instructions (B) which is read to generate control signals
(C) and copies those instructions (D). Rather than
reading information and then writing information, a
universal constructor reads information and then moves
a robotic arm. In the kinematic model, the universal
constructor exists in an environment comprising a sea of
prefabricated parts. A part is randomly selected and
inspected to identify it. If it is the required part, it is
joined to the growing assembly; if not, it is returned
back into the environment and another part selected.
Once fully assembled, the copy is supplied with a copy
of the program of instructions which is then activated.
The parts in the environment included both mechanical
elements for implementing mechanisms and logic
elements for implementing control – in fact, 8
elementary parts: (i) p or q logic gate; (ii) p and q logic

modules and cannot be considered self-replicating. True
self-replication must emerge from the dust.
A self-replicating factory will need a means to
acquire raw materials and the means to convert these
raw materials into final products. Moore’s artificial
plants concept went beyond self-assembly to suggest
machines capable of ingesting air, water and soil as raw
material powered by solar energy to grow and procreate
(Moore, 1956). We have considered 3D printing as a
universal construction mechanism in which raw
feedstock is lain in 2D layer by 2D layer and built into
3D structures. The biological ribosome encapsulates a
similar core process through 3D protein synthesis of 1D
polypeptide chains from amino acid constituents. In this
case, transfer RNA acts as the constructing arm while
messenger RNA acts as the program tape – our
engineered analogues are electric motors as the
fundamental component of robotic machines (such as
mining robots, 3D printers, assembly manipulators, etc)
and vacuum tubes as the fundamental component of a
computing machine. Conceptually, our macroscale selfreplicator envisaged here combines both von Neumann
kinematic and Moore concepts. It is a universal
constructor comprising an automated factory with
mining robots to acquire comminuted raw materials for
input to chemical refining units to extract feedstock for
fabrication and construction machines to output parts
and components for assembly robots to construct final
products. Its application is similar to that proposed in
the 1980 NASA study involving self-replicating
factories on the Moon (Freitas and Gilbreath, 1980;
Freitas and Zachary, 1981). The self-replicating seed
factory was perceived to be 100 tonnes constituting a
seed which could expand and grow to its full capacity
for one year prior to the self-replication phase. This
NASA reference design comprised a range of computercontrolled robotic vehicles – (i) paving robots mounting
parabolic mirrors sinter lunar regolith into a hard basalt
foundation surface – this may be supplemented with the
laying of rails to reduce navigation requirements of nonmining robots; (ii) front end loader and bucket/dozer
mining robots for trenching, strip and spiral mining; (iii)
electric carts on rails for transporting material and
components within the factory and casting robots for
tool and mould construction; and (iv) assembly robots
for assembling fabricated parts stored in warehouses.
Infrastructure included a radio transponder network to
implement local navigation/communications for robot
coordination. This enables a central computer control
system at the hub to coordinate all robots. Power of 1.7
MW was implemented through an overhead canopy of
solar cells erected by mining and assembly robots.
Chemical refining of lunar regolith was based on
electrophoretic separation followed by HF acid leaching.
Chlorine for extracting aluminium was considered to be
the limiting reagent – we concur with this (and sodium)
though for different reasons. Indeed, in our case, this
provides a mechanism for mitigation of uncontrolled
replication – a salt contingency in which Na and Cl must

gate; (iii) p and ~q logic gate; (iv) rigid link; (v) joining
element; (vi) cutting element; (vii) sensory element, and
(viii) actuator element. Recognition of each of these
elements in the environment depends on their properties
detected by sensory elements. The self-replicator would
then make a copy of its program tape using a program
copier. The instructions are thus read twice: once as
instructions to be interpreted, then as data to be copied.
In biological systems, this is differentiated by
transcription and translation of DNA. The universal
constructor may construct any machine given the
appropriate instructions and raw material. The need for
energy was not considered specifically. Artificial life
considered here – let us call it engineered life to
differentiate it from artificial and synthetic life - is
hardware-based which although restrictive with respect
to software simulation (especially in exploring its
evolutionary properties) introduces its own insights into
physical implementation – indeed, we suggest that any
useful physical self-replicator must be a universal
constructor.
Because the basic units of the von Neumann kinematic
model are complex modules to be assembled, this is
more properly a form of self-assembly. An example is a
physical template-based self-replication process that
exploited stochastic perturbations (Penrose and Penrose,
1957). Multiple copies of 2D plywood tiles with two
specific shapes that uniquely fit together in a tray are
subjected to random shaking. In the correct
configuration, the two shapes A and B form a composite
configuration AB or BA. More complex self-replication
(self-assembly) of modules has been implemented
physically as towers of “molecubes” (Zykov et al,
2005). The molecubes are 10 cm sided cubes with a
diagonal axis through which the molecube is split into
two halves that can swivel with respect to each other.
Encapsulated within the molecube is a motor and a
microcontroller. Each face of the molecube contains
electromagnets that can be energized to attach to other
molecubes. On swivelling, attached molecubes may
move and further molecubes may be added – selfassembly rather than self-replication though it can
replicate any configuration. Molecubes are reminiscent
of 3D physical manifestations of 2D cellular automata.
This represents one of number of different approaches to
self-assembly of modular units - there are three families
of reconfigurable robotics (Yim et al, 2007; Patil et al,
2013): (i) lattice-based configurations form a cubic or
hexagonal grid of modules, e.g. molecubes; (ii) chainbased configurations forming trees or chains, e.g.
Polybot, MTRAN, CONRO, etc; (iii) mobile
architectures that can form chains, lattices or functional
robots, e.g. CEBOT. Most artificial mechanisms for
configuration require controlled movement for assembly
of the units while biological self-assembly is stochastic
(e.g. through Brownian motion) for which there are few
artificial examples beyond the Penrose tiles example.
All these self-assemblers are composed of complex

A self-replicating electromechanical intelligence
system represented a further step by copying both its
program and its hardware circuitry (Kim et al, 2004;
Hastings et al, 2004). It also utilized Lego Mindstorms
kits and comprised five main components – (i) a control
circuit comprising motor driver, motor controller,
feedback controller, and optical reader decoder based on
logic gates constructed from resistors, capacitors,
transistors and switches; (ii) a 2 DOF dual set of robotic
arms for assembling circuit elements and feeding
physical code components onto the conveyor belt
respectively; (iii) a conveyor belt for moving coloured
code components to the code reader, (iv) an optical
reader array to read colour codes defining discrete
actuator positions for acquiring electrical components,
and (v) a vertical hopper to guide circuit modules into a
copied assembly of the control circuit. This represents a
physical instantiation of self-replication of basic
modules by self-inspection.
One of the most significant problems is that as the
number of unique parts increases, the manufacturing
complexity increases exponentially, favouring the use of
standardized parts – ultimately, the adoption of simple
modular blocks converts self-replication into a selfassembly process (Stevens, 2009). However, this and
other self-assembling systems do not consider
manufacture of the modules. Our approach does indeed
consider these aspects. In particular, we utilize 3D
printing to tackle the most challenging of products
required for robotic machines – electric motors. We also
propose 3D printing vacuum tubes for electronics and
the adoption of neural network computer architectures.
Rather than architectural issues, we are tackling the
nuts-and-bolts issues in an attempt to make selfreplicating machines an engineering reality. This is a
bottom-up approach rather than top-down approach.

be supplied from Earth for replication to proceed.
Fabrication for converting feedstock into parts was
through mould casting and machining and welding by
CO2 lasers. Manipulator arms and tooling would
perform construction and assembly of components and
parts as in the von Neumann kinematic model.
Mechatronic components such as motors, sensors and
electronics would be supplied from Earth as “vitamins”.
The Lackner-Wendt concept is similar in comprising a
colony of robotic vehicles running on a grid of
electrified tracks within a manufacturing facility for
extracting raw material from desert regions powered by
solar cells (Lackner and Wendt, 1995). The raw
materials are the commonest elements in desert sand –
Na, Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Al, C, O2 and H2 – which are
extracted through carbothermic reduction.
The Chirikjian-Suthakorn concept is a further
development of self-replicating robots for lunar
application (Chirikjian et al, 2002). It comprised four
major subsystems: (i) mobile robots with manipulators
for mining, transport and assembly of material or
components; (ii) regolith sintering, chemical refining
and metal casting and other parts manufacturing
facilities; (iii) solar energy system based on solar
collectors, photovoltaic energy conversion and fuel
cells, (iv) electromagnetic railguns for long range
delivery of offspring. The Chirikjian-Suthakorn concept
demonstration was based on Lego Mindstorms kits
comprising a system of robots capable of assembling
component modules into replicated robots. Lego
provides a modular approach in which standard blocks
and plates of ABS plastic with standard mechanical
interfaces can be configured into different assemblies. A
simple robot comprised of several subsystems –
left/right motors, left/right wheels and/or tracks,
manipulator wrist, passive gripper and robot control
system microcontroller – was demonstrated to construct
a copy of itself. It was programmed with an assembly
sequence to construct a copy of itself in an assembly
area of components using a series of assembly jig
fixtures – chassis, motor/wheels, and gripper units - for
aligning components for each subassembly. The robot
controller was required to program and operate the robot
between stations for the assembly. The assembly
stations were fairly complex involving conveyor
belt/pulley/lift units with sensory feedback, docking unit
with sensors, electrical connectors for electrical power,
and controller units. Lego was also used for a selfreplicating three axis Cartesian manipulator capable of
constructing a copy of itself from Lego components
(Moses et al, 2014). It comprised 45 parts (of 11
different types) assembled through a sequence of 410
steps though it lacked any form of automated controller.
The 11 different types were dominated by racks and
rails but most significantly included prefabricated
electric motors. Although Lego has snap-fit assembly,
many parts were tapered or chamfered in order to permit
positioning errors during assembly.

Implications
An interesting question concerns whether the selfreplicating machine advocated here constitutes artificial
life. It has been suggested that a key feature of heritable
genetic representation is non-holonomy which
introduces alternative trajectories for a dynamic system
(Pattee, 2001). The kinetic energy dynamics and
momentum cannot be uniquely integrated to specific
potential energy trajectories. This non-conservation of
force yields energy degeneracy in which there are
alternative configuration states with the same energy
that cannot be uniquely determined via mathematical
integration. The configuration is trajectory-dependent,
i.e. it is rate-dependent on the history of previous states.
A physical example is the non-holonomy of angular
momentum conservation in a general kinematic
mechanism that cannot be integrated into a unique
conservation of angular moments because of the noncommutativity of sequences of rotations. There is a
dependence on the history of angular states. An infinite

(Stengel, 1994)). This mutation must be heritable so it
applies only to self-replication errors in genetic copying.
This is relatively straight forward to minimize through
error detection and correction coding (EDAC) (Shirvani
et al, 2000). Indeed, artificial neural networks can
implement Viterbi decoding based on analogue neurons
(Wang and Wicker, 1996). The third requirement is the
there is a selection process in which there is a variation
in the phenotypic success between offspring within the
constraints of resource limitations. All technologically
designed systems are brittle and any non-nominal
variation will fail due to lack of robustness. A pertinent
example is genetic programs that self-replicate through
only through genetic cross-over but cannot exploit
mutation (Koza, 1993). Given the difficulty in creating
viable self-replication, it is vanishingly unlikely that
random mutational variation will yield improved
fecundity. Furthermore, such variations will be detected
and corrected through EDAC. It is desirable to prevent
evolutionary change in order to retain control of the selfreplicator. An additional mechanism is the salt
contingency mentioned earlier – imported Cl is required
for silicone plastics manufacture and Na for quartz
manufacture without which self-replication cannot
proceed. Multiple layers of safeguards should provide
sufficient protection against the grey goo scenario.

number of historical paths can yield a particular
orientation state. This affords unpredictability to the
dynamics of such systems. Evolutionary processes are
non-holonomic explorations in phase space and this is a
hallmark of life. The artificially constructed selfreplicating machine presented here (and others similar to
it) has no evolutionary history and therefore does not
constitute artificial life (Ellery, 2015). If subsequent
evolutionary processes are permitted however, this
changes. The introduction of an evolutionary
exploration to the self-replicating machine implies that it
will then constitute an artificial lifeform. The great fear
is the grey goo scenario in which self-replication
becomes uncontrollable. However, there are practical
difficulties to this scenario. For evolutionary processes
to operate, certain conditions are required. The first
requirement is self-replication in which copies are
manufactured with the offspring inheriting properties
from the parents – this is true by definition for the selfreplicating machine. The second requirement is that the
self-replicating system must suffer from variations due
to genetic mutation of which there are two types
(Ikegami and Hashimoto, 1995): passive mutation
resulting from external noise from the environment and
active mutation resulting from noise in the selfreplication process itself (in Kalman filtering, this is
quantified as sensor and model noise respectively
