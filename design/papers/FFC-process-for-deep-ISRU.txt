Abstract
Most in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) techniques proposed to date are focussed on the extraction of
consumables requiring minimal processing for the support of human missions to the Moon or Mars. Water in
particular has been the beguiling jewel to which we have been drawn. We define this as shallow ISRU to illustrate
that its extraction requires minimal processing. We are interested in deep ISRU – investing in the hard problem of
extraction and processing of material that permits us to create physical infrastructure on the Moon. We submit that a
new approach to space exploration beckons in which deep ISRU permits the robotic construction of an entire
automated infrastructure on the Moon at low cost. By leveraging the enormous resources available of the Moon, the
cost of human lunar missions can be reduced substantially. Our hypothesis is that following resource acquisition by
bucket wheel, comminution and electrostatic/magnetic beneficiation, lunar regolith can be subjected to the FFC
Cambridge process followed by 3D printing using either selective laser sintering or electron beam freeform
fabrication. The FFC Cambridge process is an electrolytic technique that can extract near pure metals from their
oxide and silicate forms. The two lunar minerals on which we have focussed are anorthite (common in the highland
regions) and ilmenite (common in the maria regions). From these two minerals, an entire suite of metals can be
extracted in alloy form, or if subjected to prior purification methods, in pure form – Al, Ca, Si from anorthite and Fe
and Ti from ilmenite in alloy forms, or pure Al from alumina, pure Ti from rutile and pure Si from silica. The CaCl 2
electrolyte is recycled requiring only Cl import from Earth in salt form to replenish small losses. Furthermore, the
output of the FFC Cambridge process is powder (or wire) suitable as input for powder metallurgy and metal 3D
printing by electron beam freeform fabrication and selective laser sintering. Essentially, only two processes – FFC
Cambridge and metal 3D printing – converts beneficiated raw material into final products. These two methods offer
unprecedented capabilities in deep ISRU.

1. Introduction
For long duration life support systems, it is
considered essential to recycle everything to maximise
consumption efficiency and minimise waste – this is the
closed ecological life support system (CELSS). The
term ecology implies a closed recycling system to re-use
consumables. For example, solid state electrolysis may
be used to recover oxygen from carbon dioxide and
water (artificial photosynthesis): 2CO2 → 2CO + O2 and
2H2O → 2H2 + O2. A number of suitable solid state
electrolytes include calcia-stabilised zirconia or yttriadoped ceria at 850oC with an electrical energy
consumption of 250 W. However, current environment
control and life support systems (ECLSS) do not offer
full closed loop recycling. Both ECLSS and CELSS
must be supplemented by in-situ resource utilisation
(ISRU) to supply raw materials for consumption and to

IAC-17-D4.5.4x39364

replace inevitable losses. For this reason, most ISRU
techniques proposed to date have been devoted to the
supply of consumables – water and oxygen. This is
shallow ISRU.
Deep ISRU relates to more extensive use of space
resources to support the in-situ construction,
maintenance, repair and growth of infrastructure such as
lunar habitats. Our interest is in building a selfreplicating machine on the Moon entirely from lunar
resources. This imposes a severe objective of a near100% supply from in-situ resources. In fact, the scheme
presented here requires the import of NaCl from Earth
as a reagent (salt contingency). As humans begin to
colonise the surface of the Moon and other planets, do
we wish to bring our profligate habits with us? We have
unfortunately begun by trailing our detritus into space
up to GEO in the form of space debris. As we progress

beyond GEO to the Moon and other celestial bodies, we
must commit to sustainable exploration.
2. Lunar Geology
Lunar rock and regolith is constructed from minerals
and glasses [1]. The dominant lunar silicates are
pyroxenes (Ca,Fe,Mg)2Si2O6, plagioclase feldspar
(Ca,Na)(Al2Si)4O8, and olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4. The
highlands are dominated by plagioclase, anorthite
(CaAl2Si2O8) with some pyroxene (Mg,Ca,Fe)SiO3 and
olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4. The mare is basaltic with varying
proportions of plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine with up
to 20% ilmenite FeTiO3 and/or 10% spinel
(Fe,Mg)(Cr,Al,Fe,Ti)2O4. Many minerals exhibit a
range of compositions which are flanked by two or
more end members. Lunar olivine is concentrated in
mare soil being of low abundance in highland soils.
Lunar olivine varies from Mg2SiO4 (forsterite) to
Fe2SiO4 (fayalite) with intermediate solid solutions
(Mg,Fe)2SiO4 and is enriched in Cr compared to
terrestrial olivines. Lunar plagioclase is dominated by
the calcium end member, anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) but
depleted in the sodium end member, albite (NaAlSi3O8).
The lunar highlands represent the original lunar crust of
anorthosite rock dominated by the mineral anorthite
CaAl2Si2O8, i.e. rich in Ca and Al. Lunar mare represent
more recent magma outflows of basalt comprising
plagioclase (primarily anorthite), orthopyroxene
(Mg,Fe)SiO3, clinopyoxene Ca(Fe,Mg)Si2O6, olivine
(Mg,Fe)2SiO4, and ilmenite FeTiO3, i.e. rich in Fe, Ti
and Mg. Pyroxene has three end members MgSiO3
(enstatite), CaSiO3 (wollastonite), and FeSiO3
(ferrosilite). Orthopyroxenes have the two end
members, enstatite and ferrosilicate. All other pyroxenes
are clinopyroxenes. Pyroxenes are ubiquitous in lunar
regolith – primarily, clinopyroxene in the mare regions
but both clinopyroxene and orthopyroxenes occur in the
highlands. Magnesium pyroxenes and enstatite are
depleted compared to Earth. KREEP rocks are enriched
plagioclases that occur in localised regions. Sodium
feldspars and potassium feldspars are rare as are
granites, silica, clays, micas and amphiboles which
require water for their formation. Metal oxides are
abundant especially in the mare basalts. The Fe content
of mare basalt feldspar is much higher than highland
anorthosite feldspar. The commonest oxide is ilmenite
(Fe,Mg)TiO3 followed by spinels. Spinels are present
but only as minor constituents of lunar soil. Spinel endmembers include spinel (MgAl2O4), ulvospinel
(Fe2TiO4), chromite (FeCr2O4) and hercynite (FeAl2O4).
Ti-rich basalts have higher than 6% TiO2 by weight in
the form of ilmenite and are found in Oceanus
Procellarum and Mare Tranquillitatis on the
nearside.Iron metal occurs widely in lunar regolith but
at low concentrations <1% as Fe or NiFe nanophase
grains from meteoritic sources. Troilite is ubiquitous but

IAC-17-D4.5.4x39364

in low concentrations and is associated with ilmenite
and spinel. This yields a characteristic elemental
abundance in Table 1.
Solar wind has impregnated the lunar regolith with
volatiles. Lunar regolith comprises a repository of solar
wind-derived volatiles in the upper 2-3 m due to
gardening by impacts [2]. The abundance of solar wind
volatiles in regolith is directly correlated with the
duration of its exposure (maturity) [3]. Maturity is
indicated by the degree of glass agglutination and
degree of nanophase Fe0 metallicity to FeO. Carbon
mixture comprises primarily CO and smaller but similar
amounts of CO2 and CH4. Nitrogen is primarily in the
form of N2 in similar amounts to CH4. Sulphur is
released on heating as both H2S and SO2. All F and Cl
are released as HF and HCl respectively. Noble gases
such as Ar are in trace amounts (3.1x10-4 cm3 STP/g for
36
Ar). 3He enrichment in the smallest grains of high
TiO2 (ilmenite) deposits by a factor of 100 favours prior
separation of the <20 μm ilmenite fraction [4]. He3 is
regarded as potentially valuable as a nuclear fusion fuel
for D/3He reaction as it generates fewer neutrons than
other fusion fuels. It is rare on Earth (estimated at
around 2 x 104 kg) – the global lunar inventory is
estimated at 6.5 x 108 kg [5]. Heating to 700oC yields
releases almost all the volatiles. Fractional distillation
requires a vertical fractionating column to use density as
a means of component separation [6]. The mixture is
heated at the bottom of the column from which vapours
rise and condense towards the top of the column. The
column may be packed or plated with sieve trays to
permit vapour flow upwards but reducing liquid flow
downwards. Although lunar gravity is one-sixth that of
Earth, the vapour-liquid thermodynamics within the
fractionating column is the same such that gas velocity
is given by:

v  QA  C

 L  G
G

(1)

where Q=volumetric gas flow rate, A=column area,
C=flooding constant, ρL=liquid density, ρG=gas density.
It is the column area that must be adjusted to the Moon:
AM
AE



gM

(2)

Hence, the lunar cross section diameter must be 1.6
times that of an Earth column diameter for similar
performance.

3. Industrial Ecology
Sustainability must be built into human exploration
and colonisation goals upfront as a design requirement,
not as an ad hoc afterthought, in much the same way as
planetary protection is built into robotic exploration
missions [8]. Sustainability is built on two pillars: (i)
dematerialisation through the minimisation of material
consumption; (ii) detoxification of waste. Industrial
ecology addresses (ii) by converting waste in resources.
The IPAT equation quantifies the impact I to be
minimised – it is a complex function of the cost of
launch of assets from Earth: I=PAT where P=population
of industrial products produced by deep ISRU,
A=cumulative resource units consumed per product
produced (specific mass), T=impact per resource unit
consumed (amount of waste). To reduce A requires
dematerialisation and to reduce T requires
detoxification. Industrial ecology seeks to reduce impact
T through recycling. Self-replication enforces
minimisation of A through material and energy closure.
Industrial ecology minimises the waste of one process
by feeding it as input to other processes. It is of course
highly desirable to achieve 100% closed loop recycling.
Furthermore, there is a requirement for cradle-to-cradle
sustainability which requires recycling at end-of-life –
the recycling of 3D printed powder feedstock provides
such a facility. FFC Cambridge is central to the
minimisation/detoxification of waste by its yield of high
purity metal.
4. Inexorability of Electrolysis
Electrolytic methods of mineral oxides tend to
output higher product yields with higher purity than
thermochemical reduction. Electrolysis is a highly
versatile mode of chemical processing which is widely
adopted on Earth. Aluminium production on Earth
involves the mining of bauxite, production of alumina
from bauxite (Bayer process) and alumina reduction to

IAC-17-D4.5.4x39364

Al metal electrolytically (Hall-Heroult process). Bauxite
is typically up to 40% alumina, 10-30% Fe2O3, 5-20%
SiO2 and around 2-5% TiO2. The Bayer process
dissolves bauxite in NaOH solution to precipitate
Al(OH)3 which is calcined to produce Al2O3. Molten
NaOH could also be used to treat ilmenite to
preferentially dissolve TiO2 leaving insoluble Fe2O3.
Alumina is passed into a Hall-Heroult electrochemical
cell as Al2O3 dissolved in molten Na3AlF6 (cryolite)
solution at 960oC for electrolytic reduction using
graphite electrodes which are consumed:
½Al2O3 + ¾C → Al + ¾CO2
½Al2O3 + 1½C → Al + 1½CO
Molten Al is tapped at the bottom of the cell.
Currently, Al production produces CO2 greenhouse
gases (0.5 kg C per kg Al produced) resulting from
oxygen release at graphite anodes and toxic
perfluorocarbon (such as CF4 and C2F6) emissions due
to reactions with molten cryolite.
Aluminium production is highly energy intensive
with 30% of its production cost being energy, two-thirds
of which is used in the Hall-Heroult process [9]. The
Hall-Heroult process consumes 14 kWh/kg accounting
for 75% of the total energy consumption of aluminium
production (electrolyte heating is electrical).
Carbothermal reduction of bauxite with graphite powder
has been proposed to reduce this energy consumption by
30% [10]. It also eliminates F compound pollutant
production. Carbothermal reduction is a general method
of reducing metal oxides:
MxOy + yC → xM + yCO
Carbothermal reduction is the basis of blast furnace
processing of iron ore to yield iron and steel.
Carbothermal reduction of alumina may be represented
as:
Al2O3 + 3C → 2Al + 3CO
Al2O3 + 3CH4 → 2Al + 3CO + 6H2
This requires high temperatures of 2060oC and
1500oC respectively due to the high stability of Al2O3.
This approach offers poor yields due to the formation of
metal carbide constituents. Two-stage processing
involving the formation of Al4C3 in Al2O3 slag at
2200oC (or 1500oC at 1000 Pa) requires subsequent
electrolysis at 2000oC to yield Al metal. Stepped
heating of bauxite at 1100oC and 1200oC yields metallic
iron and ferroalloy of Al-Si (with carbides of Ti, Si and
Al) respectively. An indirect rather than direct
carbothermal process of alumina reduction involves the
production of intermediate Al compounds such as AlCl3
followed by the Alcoa electrolytic process. Intermediate
product
techniques
include
carbochlorination,
carbonitridation
and
carbosulphidation
[11].
Carbochlorination begins at 1600oC under 150 Pa
pressure is typical:
Al2O3 + 3C + Cl2 → 2AlCl3 + 3CO
Al2O3 + 3CO + 3Cl2 → 2Al + 3CO2

Carbochlorination of lunar anorthite follows a
similar principle though reduction of oxides will yield
Ca-Al-Si alloy. Prior separation of CaO may be
warranted if cement production is implemented.
Extraction of Al from AlCl3 may be either through low
yield condensation or through electrolysis. AlCl3 vapour
may be passed through Al alloy above 1000oC followed
by condensation at 700oC:
3AlCl3 → Al + AlCl3
Formation of CaCl2 and SiCl4 from anorthite
complicates the process:
CaO-Al2O3-2SiO2 +8 C + 8Cl2
→ 2AlCl3 + CaCl2 + 2SiCl4 + 8CO
The Alcoa electrolytic process dissolves AlCl3 in
NaCl-LiCl electrolyte at 730oC to generate Al (at much
lower temperature than the Hall-Heroult process)
without the consumption of carbon electrodes (with an
energy consumption of 9 kWh/kg Al). Chlorine gas may
be recycled for the carbochlorination step. Fluorination
has been proposed as the intermediate metal compounds
[12] but this involves more corrosive and severe
reagents. An alternative is the use of ionic liquids organic salts that dissolve oxides into a solution at 150160oC from which electrolysis can liberate oxygen at
the anode and metals at the cathode [13]. For example,
alumina and bauxite can be dissolved in 1-ethyl-3methyl-imidazolium hydrogen sulphate at 210oC [14].
Ionic liquids however are impractical for lunar
application.
Hence, all roads lead to the royal road of
electrolysis. Since the development of the two-stage
Bayer/Hall-Heroult processes, aluminium has displaced
cast iron, steel, tin-plate, cast zinc, copper tubing,
timber, glass and cardboard. However, for lunar
application, it is an open question whether aluminium
production is necessary as its functions can be
substituted for with iron alloys (including kovar).
Conversely, aluminium production would not eliminate
the need for subsurface access to meteoritic material
such as tungsten because its low concentration in
surface regolith. Nevertheless. electrolytic processes are
favoured for lunar application. Molten regolith
electrolysis involves melting regolith at 1600oC and
then applying a potential difference between the two
electrodes. Oxygen is evolved at the anode and metals at
the cathode (iron, silicon, etc). Molten oxide electrolysis
is much favoured because it requires no reagents and
yields high purity but it requires considerable energy. Pt
group metals such as Ir for the anode exhibit potential
long life durability.
5. FFC Cambridge Process
The FFC Cambridge process is an electrolytic
process which reduces mineral oxides to 99% pure
metal. The raw mineral oxide is pre-processed by
powdering, compacting and sintering into a cathode rod.

IAC-17-D4.5.4x39364

It is inserted into an electrolytic cell with molten salt
CaCl2 as the electrolyte at 900oC in conjunction with an
appropriate anode. Nominally, a graphite electrode is
employed, yielding CO/CO2 gas evolved at the anode.
At the appropriate electrical potential (3 V being
typical), the cathode is reduced to sintered solid pure
metal releasing O2- ions into the electrolyte solution
which are transported to the anode to form CO/CO2 gas
which is released:
Cathode: MeOx + 2xe- → Me + xO2Anode: C + O2- → CO + 2e- and C +2O2- → CO2 +4eAny metal oxide can be reduced in this manner.
Reduction of the metal oxide occurs in the solid state
without melting yielding reduced energy consumption.
The electrolyte is not consumed (except through
cathode removal due to its porosity) but the anode is,
and must be replenished – essentially, this is an
electrolytic version of carbothermal reduction of
mineral oxides. Capturing and recycling the CO/CO2
gas and reducing it to carbon will be necessary to
conserve the carbon. To obviate against the loss of
carbon, an inert anode would be desirable to release O2
gas directly (2O2- → O2 +2e-) [15]. SnO2 doped with 2%
Sb2O3 and 1% CuO was successful as an inert anode but
it eroded rapidly; a more promising anode was a solid
solution of calcium titanate and calcium ruthenate
(CaTixRu1-xO3). The O2 released as a waste product may
be stored for human consumption or as propellant
oxidiser. Thermal heating to the modest 900oC could be
accomplished through solar concentrators such as
Fresnel lenses. We have demonstrated Fresnel lens
smelting of Al alloy at 800oC under field conditions
(Fig 1).

Fig 1. Smelting of Al alloy pieces using a Fresnel
lens-based solar concentrator
Distribution of the thermal energy through the
electrolytic bath however may prove challenging.
Electrical energy may be supplied through thermionic
conversion at 10-15% efficiency.

We investigate two options for FFC Cambridge
process on lunar minerals. First, we discuss the
application of the technique to raw lunar minerals to
yield mongrel alloys. Commonly used alloys typically
comprise a single dominant metal with the addition of
small amounts of other metals but mongrel alloys are
dependent on the initial constituents of the mineral.
Nominally, the FFC Cambridge process can be used to
reduce lunar ilmenite (FeTiO3) from mare regions to
FeTi alloy. General FeTi alloy may be employed for
general purpose structures; ferrotitanium alloy (45-75%
Ti) may be used for oxidant mop-up purification, or as a
pyrotechnic powder fuel with O2 oxidant. Its oxygenscavenging properties may not prevent its general use
on the Moon but it should not be employed where free
O2 is in proximity.
The FFC Cambridge process can be used to reduce
lunar anorthite (CaAl2Si2O3) from highland regions to
AlCaSi alloy. AlCaSi alloy may be used for general
purpose structures. Aluminium-silicon is a common
filler metal used for brazing aluminum. Brazing
involves melting a lower melting point filler to join two
metal parts in a gas flux to prevent oxidation
(unnecessary in a vacuum). Nickel alloy is used for
joining steels while cobalt is used for joining
superalloys but brazing does not have the high strength
of a welded joint. AlSi alloys (20-50% Si) are used for
casting and welds whereby Si provides fluidity with low
shrinkage. As they solidify, the Si particles provide high
wear resistance and low thermal expansion. To
compensate for Fe contamination, Ni and Co may be
added to improve strength. AlSi alloy exhibits lower
viscosity than pure aluminium and is suitable for casting
or powder metallurgy. Etching yields a hardened, highly
wear-resistant silicon precipitate that is porous enough
to retain oil that is suitable for linerless reciprocating
components. Hence, silumin (3-25% Si) alloy is an AlSi
alloy used for high durability applications such as in the
lining of moving parts for machines such as pistons.
The FFC Cambridge process may reduce lunar
olivine (Mg2SiO4) from crater regions directly to MgSi
alloy. MgSi alloys may be used for general purpose
structures; small amounts of Mg2Si alloy are added to
Al to produce high strength Al alloy.
The properties of these mongrel alloys – FeTi,
AlCaSi and MgSi - needs to be investigated further,
particularly for general purpose structural applications.
There is a general requirement for tensile structures to
complement current interest in 3D printing compressive
structures on the Moon [16,17]. The specialised
applications of the mongrel alloys are insufficiently
useful to justify the use of the FFC Cambridge process
directly to unprocessed lunar minerals.
7. Smart FFC Cambridge Process

IAC-17-D4.5.4x39364

The versatility of the FFC Cambridge process
however is best realised in the reduction of pure metal
oxides. Hence, we must employ thermochemical preprocessing to lunar minerals to reduce them to pure
metal oxides. Lunar ilmenite may be reduced through
hydrogen reduction at 900-1000oC:
FeTiO3 + H2 → Fe + TiO2 + H2O
2H2O → 2H2 + O2
The product is a solid sponge of rutile and iron
which could either be hammered out or ground into
powder (such in a ball mill) to separate out the
respective constituents. Alternatively, further heating to
1600oC allows bleeding of molten Fe from TiO2 but the
TiO2 sponge will retain some Fe unless further
processed. Some residual impurities including iron may
be useful in producing titanium alloys. The water
vapour is electrolytically separated into H2 which is
recycled and O2 which is stored for subsequent use.
Ulvospinel can also be reduced in a similar manner:
Fe2TiO4 + H2 → TiO2 + 2Fe + H2O
CH4 can also reduce ilmenite, enstatite and
wollastonite at 1600oC:
FeTiO3 + CH4 → Fe + TiO2 + CO + 2H2
MgSiO3 + 2CH4 → Si + MgO + 2CO + 4H2
CaSiO3 + 2CH4 → Si + CaO + 2CO + 4H2
CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O
The disadvantage is that it requires CH4 but CO can
be recycled. Reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen
or methane is the simplest approach but the resultant
purity is limited. Vapour phase pyrolysis involves
decomposition and vaporisation of mineral oxides above
2000oC:
FeTiO3 → Fe + TiO2 + ½O2
MgSiO3 → SiO + MgO + ½O2
CaSiO3 → SiO + CaO + ½O2
Vapour phase pyrolysis is more versatile requiring
no chemical reagent but requires very high
temperatures. Hot concentrated sulphuric acid can
reduce ilmenite:
FeTiO3 + 2H2SO4 → FeSO4 + TiOSO4 + 2H2O
Iron sulphate precipitate must be dissolved and
electrolysed:
FeSO4 + H2O → Fe + ½O2 + H2SO4
Titanium sulphate may be hydrolysed: TiOSO4 +
H2O → H2SO4 + TiO2
The acid may be recycled. The use of acids such as
HF, HCl or H2SO4 requires import of such corrosive
reagents from Earth and yield complex reaction
sequences. Nevertheless, there are a host of preprocessing options.
Iron is a versatile metal that lends itself to multiple
applications. Wrought (pure) iron is tough and
malleable, suitable for tensile (or compressive loads if
designed appropriately such as I beams) in structures.
Steel requires the addition of small amounts <2%
carbon as the dominant additive. Tool steel (<2% C and

9-18% W) is durable steel used for cutting tools for low
wear. Silicon steel (up to 3% Si) is electrical steel used
for electromagnet and motor cores. Kovar (53.5% Fe,
29% Ni, 17% Co, 0.3% Mn, 0.2%Si and <0.01% C) is a
type of fernico alloy with high electrical and thermal
conductivity as a replacement for copper and/or
aluminum conducting wire. Permalloy (20% Fe and
80% Ni) provides magnetic shielding around motor
devices to protect adjacent electronics from stray
magnetic fields. The more exotic materials may be
sourced from impact craters exhibiting magnetic
anomalies indicating the existence of impactor metals
[18]. Kamacite/taenite (NiFe alloys with 4-30% Ni)
contaminated with ~0.5% Co is the major constituent in
nickel-iron meteorites. Ni and Fe may be extracted
through the Mond process. For Ni, this requires reacting
CO with an S catalyst at 40-80oC and 1 bar to form
nickel carbonyl gas which is then reversed at 230oC and
60 bar:
Ni + 4CO ↔ Ni(CO)4
Fe purification requires different conditions:
Fe + 5CO ↔ Fe(CO)5 at 175oC and 100 bar
The S catalyst may be recovered at 750-1100oC
from troilite FeS in meteoritic inclusions, lunar regolith
(~1%) or lunar volatiles. CO may be derived from lunar
volatiles or the FFC Cambridge process if using a
graphite anode. Removal of Ni and Fe concentrates the
Co fraction of the residual ore. Alternatively, Co may be
extracted by roasting with S in oxygen to convert cobalt
into cobalt sulphate which is soluble in water. Co may
then be extracted electrolytically. Meteoritic NiFe alloys
are also enriched in W microparticle inclusions at a
concentration of 0.1-5 μg/g. Following grinding, the
high density of W at 19.3 lends itself to extraction by
froth flotation.
Once ilmenite has been reduced to rutile TiO2, FFC
Cambridge process may be employed to yield near pure
Ti (Fig 2a and b) – indeed, the FFC Cambridgr process
was originally developed to extract Ti from rutile to
replace the Kroll process.

IAC-17-D4.5.4x39364

Fig 2. (a) rutile feedstock input to FFCC; (b) Ti
metal product output from FFCC
Anorthite may be subjected to carbothermal
reduction to alumina feedstock at 1650oC:
CaAl2Si2O8 + 4C → CaO + Al2O3 + 2Si + 4CO
The mixture of metal oxides and silicon requires
separation after powdering – the addition of Al metal
powder at high temperature scavenges oxygen (by
forming further Al2O3) and reduces CaO to Ca metal
which may be tapped off as liquid above 842oC.
Alternatively, CaO may be reacted highly
exothermically with HCl to yield CaCl2 electrolyte
directly:
CaO + 2HCl → CaCl2 + H2O
The reaction of powdered Si with HCl at 300oC
yields volatile trichlorosilane liquid:
Si + 3HCl → HCl3Si + H2
Removal of H2 allows reversal to yield purified
polysilicon:
HCl3Si → Si + HCl + Cl2
Hence, chlorine is recycled. The alumina may be
subjected to FFC Cambridge process to yield pure
aluminium metal. An alternative treatment of anorthite
is artificial weathering with HCl at room temperature to
yield SiO2:
CaAl2Si2O8 + 8HCl +2H2O
→ CaCl2 + 2AlCl3.6H2O + 2SiO2
SiO2 may be employed for fused silica glass
production and for the production of quartz
(piezoelectric sensing material). Aluminium chloride
hexahydrate may be melted above 100oC to separate it
from CaCl2 and SiO2 – it may subsequently be heated to
yield alumina at 400oC:
2AlCl3.6H2O → Al2O3 + 6HCl + 9H2O
Silica and alumina may then be reduced separately
through the FFC Cambridge process. Si may be
employed as an additive to Fe for silicon steel. The
artificial weathering reaction produces CaCl2 as a
source of FFC Cambridge electrolyte. Soda glass cannot
be made on the Moon due to the paucity of Na but this
is not an issue on Mars where NaCl is abundant.
Aluminosilicate (57% SiO2, 20% Al2O3, 12% MgO, 5%
CaO) or fused silica glass are the only available options.
It has been proposed that lunar aluminosilicate such as

anorthite be used as the basis for glass on the Moon aluminosilicates have a melt temperature of ~11001350oC which is significantly lower than the 1700oC
required of fused silica [19]. However, the moderate to
high FeO content causes glass darkening which is
undesirable for transparency so it would have to be
removed. This may be accomplished through
purification of alumina as the basis for glass-making to
which the other components may be added in the
required proportions. High purity SiO2 can be enforced
by heating in a H2-O2 flame in the presence of SiCl4
vapour:
SiCl4 + 2H2 + O2 → SiO2 + 4HCl
Olivine may be subjected to aluminothermic
reduction in the appropriate proportions at 1000oC:
3Mg2SiO4 + 6Al
→ 2MgAl2O4 + 4MgO + 2AlSi + Si
The MgO can be reduced by AlSi by continuing the
reaction at 1000oC:
4MgO + 2AlSi → MgAl2O4 + 3Mg + 2Si
Molten Mg above 650oC enables it to be tapped
from the refractory oxide. The FFC Cambridge process
may reduce the MgAl2O4 spinel to MgAl alloy (such as
magnallum as a lightweight corrosion-resistant alloy or
solid fuel if ground) after separating it out from Mg,
AlSi alloy and pure Si.
8. 3D Printing
3D printing is a versatile method of manufacturing
that offers considerable versatility over traditional
subtractive methods. 3D printing is an additive
manufacturing process in which 3D structures are built
up sequentially layer-by-layer. The most common 3D
printing technique is fused deposition modelling (FDM)
exemplified by the RepRap 3D printer [20] (Fig 3).

Fig 3. RepRap 3D printer
The Moon possesses regolith volatiles that may be
used as raw material for the manufacture of plastics –

IAC-17-D4.5.4x39364

organic polymers may be rigid, elastic or plastic.
Polymer moduli of elasticity falls in the range 10 MPa
to 4 GPa compared with 50-400 GPa for metals. Tensile
strength of polymers is 10 – 100 MPa compared with up
to GPa for metals. Plastics have low fracture strength
compared to metals. Plastics have poor response to high
temperatures due to a reduction in tensile strength and
increased ductility. Hence, metals are better suited to
load-bearing, stiff structures while plastics are best
employed as elastomers. i.e. silicone plastics. To
minimise carbon consumption, silicone plastics have a
silicone-oxygen backbone rather than a C backbone.
Silicone plastics have advantages over hydrocarbon
plastic in that they are UV radiation resistant and
possess higher operational temperature resistance (up to
350oC). While organosilizanes are used for specialised
protective
coatings
and
adhesive
cements,
organosiloxanes are used more widely – motor
lubricants, motor insulation, sealants, adhesives and
coolant. This favours siloxanes for their wide
functionality. Siloxane manufacture begins with the
formation of syngas from methane and water (lunar
volatiles) at 850oC and 4 MPa over a Ni catalyst:
CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2
Syngas is converted to methanol (or higher alcohol)
at 250oC and 5-10 MPa over an alumina catalyst:
CO + H2 → CH3OH
Chloromethane is formed by the action of HCl on
methanol at 340oC over an alumina catalyst:
CH3OH + HCl → CH3Cl + H2O
Dialkyl dichlorosilane is formed from the reaction of
chloromethane with Si at 320-370oC and 1-5 bar in the
presence of a catalyst (Rochow process):
2CH3Cl + Si → (CH3)2SiCl2
It is an open question whether Ni could replace the
more commonly used Cu catalyst in the Rochow
process as copper is not available on the Moon. For
example, the Fischer-Tropsch reaction requires a H2:CO
ratio of 2 for a Co catalyst but an Fe catalyst can tolerate
a lower ratio. However, Fe-based catalysts also require
alkali metal promoter such as K and ceramic support
such as SiO2. The most effective catalysts are
CoFe/TiO2, Co/TiO2, CoNi/TiO2, NiFe/TiO2 and
FeCo/SiO2 for Fischer-Tropsch reactions Intriguingly,
lunar dust has been demonstrated as an effective catalyst
for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [21]. The Rochow
process catalyst requires further investigation. Finally,
the simplest silicone oil, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
is formed by hydrolysis:
n(CH3)2SiCl2 + nH2O → ((CH3)2SiO)n + 2nHCl
HCl is recycled. Hence, silicone plastics may be
manufactured from lunar volatiles given a source of Cl
reagent. Silicone plastic is suitable for 3D printing by
FDM. Furthermore, silica-based ceramics (polymerderived ceramics) may be derived from pyrolysis of
silicone polymers (organosilazanes or organosiloxanes)

- this permits shaping or 3D printing of the polymers
prior to thermal conversion to ceramics which offer high
temperature stability to 1500oC (increased by 2000oC
with the addition of Al by the sol-gel process) [22].
Polysiloxanes (RSiO1.5) can also be transformed into
piezoresistive SiOC ceramics through pyrolysis in an
inert atmosphere at or above 1400oC – the high
temperature is necessary for piezoresistivity with an
extremely high sensitivity of ~145 [23]. Hence, ceramic
structures can be 3D printed in polymer form. RepRap
represents a first step towards self-replicating machine
in that it can print most of its plastic components (and
potentially silica-based ceramics). However, it cannot
print its metal components. A derivative of the RepRap
has been developed that employs a welding head to
print metal though its accuracy is poor [24]. Our interest
here is in higher performance metal 3D printing.
The product of the FFC Cambridge process is a
metal alloy powder that may serve as feedstock for 3D
printing such as selective laser sintering/melting
(SLS/SLM) (Fig 4). SLS/SLM offers the ability to deal
with multiple materials – metals, plastics, ceramics and
glasses.

Fig 4. SLS-printed structures from FFC Cambrudgederived Ti powder
Solar concentrator-based sinterers offer an
alternative technique more suited to lunar application
but without the high power precision of the laser. Silica
with a melting point of 1600oC is usually sintered in a
high temperature furnace but the addition of Ca, Al, Mg
and Cl lowers the melting temperature to 500-700oC to
permit low power sintering at 200 W [25]. Metal gears
have been constructed from moulds of sand mixed with
sodium silicate sintered using low powered lasers.
Sodium silicate solution permeates the sand mould for
superior finish.
Alternatively, the powder may be sintered into rods
for electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) [26]
(Fig 5). Most metals – steel, nickel alloys, cobalt alloys,
copper-nickel alloys, aluminium alloys, titanium alloys,
tantalum, and tungsten but not zinc, cadmium or
magnesium alloys - can be electron beam processed but
non-metals are not suited as the electron beam needs to
couple electrically to the material.

IAC-17-D4.5.4x39364

Fig 5. Electron beam additive manufacturing
EBAM is of particular interest because of its
construction being based on the electron gun with
implications in developing self-replicating machines
[27]. In any case, metal printing typically requires high
energy
projection
such
as
electron
beam
sintering/melting, laser sintering/melting or variants on
these processes. The high energy deposition can cause
residual stresses and layer warping. For example,
EBAM imposes 2000oC peak temperatures followed by
rapid cooling. Pre-heating of the work platform between
the sample recrystallisation and melting temperature
alleviates these high thermal gradients and consequent
internal stresses.
Of particular interest is multi-material 3D printing of
which there have been several demonstrations using
freeform fabrication. A zinc-air cell comprising multiple
materials was manufactured through a similar process to
3D printing [28]. A customized Cartesian gantry robot
configuration of 3D printer was used to implement
freeform deposition with different cartridges. Two
plunger-based extruder deposition heads with integral
heaters were dedicated to plastic/metal and liquid/pastes
respectively. The material for each printer head was
easily changed by substituting different syringe
cartridges in each extruder head. The zinc-air battery
comprised multiple layers with Zn anode particles in a
KOH solution surrounded by a silver paste layer, carbon
black/MnO2 cathode catalyst in KOH solution
electrolyte, a pre-cast separator layer of insulating
ceramic foam overlying an air (oxygen) cathode
surrounded by a silver paste. The assembly was
mounted within an ABS plastic casing with copper
wiring to the electrodes. In addition, a passive flexure
joint of silicone plastic between rigid ABS plastic
members was fabricated. The silicone was impregnated
with carbon black while embedded wires of
silver/methylcellulose paste were also fabricated within
the joint – a simple actuator.
9. 3D Printing Motors
As well 3D printing metal structures, it would
considerably widen the applications of 3D printing if
mechatronic components could be 3D printed [29] –
indeed, such as a facility opens up the possibility of 3D
printing robots and other kinematic machines. Other
such kinematic machines include 3D printers, milling

machines, lathes, drills, etc. This effectively constitutes
a universal construction capability – a universal
constructor is a machine that, given the appropriate
resources, can construct any machine, including a copy
of itself [30]. A major leap towards such a universal
constructor would be demonstration that motors,
electronics and sensors can be 3D printed.
To that end, we have been attempting to 3D print a
number of motor designs. Initially, we 3D printed a
variable reluctance motor because of its lack of brushes
and simple construction – only the metal elements were
not 3D printed (Fig 6).

Fig. 7 (a) 3D printed PLA rotor with 50% iron
powder by mass; (b) powder metallurgy-manufactured
PLA motor with 50% iron powder by volume
We have since replaced the iron powder with
magnetically-soft silicon steel powder to eliminate the
minor detent problem on startup in the motors using
iron powder. To address printing of the current-carrying
wire coils, we have been photolithographically printing
coils and testing them in a pancake “air” motor
configuration (Fig 8a and b).

Fig 6. 3D printed switched reluctance motor
We then focussed on the general purpose DC
electric motor to tackle the magnetic and electrical
elements rather than just the structure. Beginning with
the rotor, we have 3D printed a motor core comprising
50% iron filings (by mass) interspersed in a polylactic
acid (PLA) matrix printed using the RepRap 3D printer
from an off-the-shelf filament (Proto-Pasta magnetic
filament) (Fig 7a). We then built a similar motor core
with 50% iron filings (by volume) in PLA to increase
the iron loading – this was manufactured using NRC’s
powder metallurgy facilities (Fig 7b). Although not 3D
printed, it could be, and demonstrates that high metal
loadings are feasible.

Fig 8. (a) Photolithographically-printed currentcarryimg coils (b) Pancake air motor test configuration
We attempted to construct a magnetically soft stator
pair similarly to our rotor - a 3D printed stator of iron
filings in PLA matrix but the stator magnetic field was
too weak (to measure) even with 800 turns of wire (Fig
9a). A second stator pair of SLS-printed magnetically
soft steel was constructed (Fig 9b) but its magnetic field
of 3G was insufficient to generate torque.

following pre-processing of raw materials to extract
99% pure metal elements. It operates in the solid state
so the product is a metal powder that can be 3D printed
directly or sintered into rod form. A variety of 3D
printing techniques are suitable including laser, electron
beam and solar concentrator forms. These two
technologies will be critical imparting to the Moon a
valuable infrastructure from which to establish lunar
colonies.

In order to reassess the stator design, we tested an
off-the-shelf magnetically-soft ferrite stator system
which yielded 20 G – sufficient to generate excellent
torque (Fig 10).

Fig 10. Non-3D printed ferrite stator demonstration
Magnetite (ferrite) may be manufactured from ferric
olivine (fayalite) from chondritic sources on the Moon
through oxidation at 400-700oC:
6Fe2SiO4 + 2O2 → 3Fe3(SiO4)2 + Fe3O4
However, native magnetite may exist in some
meteorites. The next steps will be to have a 3D printed
ferrite stator integrated into an entirely 3D printed DC
motor.
10. Conclusions
The combination of FFC Cambridge process and 3D
printing offer a powerful approach to deep ISRU.
Indeed, the FFC Cambridge process is best exploited
