•

Regolith is a widely available source of oxygen

•

All major elements in lunar regolith can be
reduced - removes constraints on location

•

Simultaneous production of metals highly
beneficial

LunarISRU workshop - July 2019

Results: Oxygen extraction
97 % of the
total oxygen
removed

simulant vs. time (CaCl2, 950 °C, 4A, inert anode)

•

Oxygen detected in gas stream lower
due to reactor corrosion (terrestrial cells
designed for CO/CO2)

•

Oxygen remaining in product a more
accurate indication of process success

Results: Metal/alloy production

Mixed alloy from bulk
lunar regolith –
potentially useful?

•

Possibility of metal/alloy
separation based on
electrolysis parameters

•

Terrestrial technology is focused on pure metal and
alloy production from various oxides

•

Off-Earth technology development for lunar oxygen can
feed into Mars metal production capabilities

Future directions
• Optimise process parameters
• Identify the sweet spot between oxygen yield
vs. processing time/energy input
• Understand the reduction behaviour of
individual minerals, how this relates to
different regolith deposits and regions, and
how this could potentially lead to metal/alloy
separation
