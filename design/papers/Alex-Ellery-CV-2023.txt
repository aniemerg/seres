VII. TEACHING DEVELOPMENT
One of the earliest lessons I had in teaching was the Balancing Studies course at Kingston
University, an ill-conceived final year course for all engineering students across the school
(around 150 students). It was designed to plug any gaps in engineering students’ knowledge by
teaching essentially remedial physics to every type of 4th year engineering student in the faculty
– mechanical, electrical/electronic, control, aerospace, and production engineering. It was illconceived because it was too late to teach these topics to too diverse a group. The first year I
taught it, it was an unmitigated disaster – discipline was difficult to enforce, students were bored
and unmotivated, and I didn’t know why I was teaching this course as it served no useful
function. I wrestled with trying to figure out what I could teach final year engineers near the end
of their studies that might be useful to them in their future careers. The following year, I decided
to teach critical thinking through the scientific method using a socratic approach covering topics
as diverse as myths, spiritual worlds, deities, psychic phenomena and extraterrestrial intelligence
in the context of belief versus the power of physical evidence. It was a fanatastic success. I was

9

told by several students that it was the most rewarding and fascinating course they had sat at
Kingston. The lesson? Students must be engaged to learn. I have tried to introduce the three
rhythms of education into my lecture courses as espoused in Alfred North Whitehead‘s Aims of
Education (1926) – a sense of wonder (what he referred to as “romance”), disciplined rigour
(which he referred to as “precision”), and application of knowledge (which he referred to as
“generalization”).
I have taught a range of courses from foundation to master’s level throughout my academic
career. They have focussed primarily on spacecraft engineering and robotics, though they have
also included more generic courses such as electronics, control and instrumentation (mostly as a
result of teaching in mechanical engineering departments where such subjects are typically
assigned to roboticists!). I have also taught robotics from a mechanical perspective (my robotics
courses have concentrated on manipulator kinematics, dynamics, trajectory interpolation and
control). According to the historian Geoffrey Elton in The Practice of History (1967), "The
university must train the mind, not fill the untrained mind with multi-coloured information and
undigested ideas, and only the proper study of an identifiable discipline according to the rules and
practices of that discipline can accomplish that fundamental purpose." He was wrong (or as
physicists like to retort with the ultimate insult: not even wrong). In my view, a major part of the
job of an engineer is to convert undigested ideas into practical solutions. As a roboticist, I am
highly critical of the notion that mechanical and electronic engineering are separate disciplines
and never the twain shall meet – roboticists cannot afford to pigeon-hole their mentality in this
fashion. Furthermore, given the systems aspects of today’s complex engineering, engineers must
be cross-trained and equipped with skills in mechanical, electronic, control and software
engineering (sometimes called mechatronics) - today, vehicles like aeroplanes or spacecraft are
built around their avionics. Furthermore, engineers must be versed in instrumentation in order to
devise and build experimental apparatus. The demarcation attitude, promulgated by the likes of
PEO which enforces separation of mechanical and electronic engineering, is destructive and
regressive (much like the PEO’s insistence that design is separable from analysis in engineering –
analysis without design is physics and design without analysis is landscape gardening!).
I believe in the primacy of the lecture as the teaching tool of choice – the use of ICT/media can be
valuable but not shoe-horned into a programme for its own sake. I do not believe that MOOCS
will replace the traditional lecture (as evidenced by their high drop-out rates) as social interaction
is a major contributor to the effectiveness of lectures – Alfred North Whitehead similarly stressed
the value of the social dimension of communal learning with one’s peers. This has been
reinforced by the COVID experience of online lecture delivery as deficient. There is a theory that
all academic engineers should be able to teach all aspects of the first two years of an engineering
degree. This may well be so, but it misses the point. Inevitably, lectures taught by academic
engineers with expertise in that subject will always be richer, deeper, more challenging and
insightful than those without. There is also a theory that all courses should be “standardised” to
ensure that any graduate lecturer can teach them from standardised course material. This is an
utter nonsense as well as a recipe for student boredom – students might as well be given the
assigned text and work through it themselves. The value of the university lecturer – indeed, the
only value of the university lecturer – lies in his/her personal experience and expertise and how it
can enlighten the subject at hand and be delivered in an instructive manner. I use anecdotal
examples all the time in my lectures and the students usually respond to that. I use every
opportunity to introduce my own research into my lectures to inject freshness and relevance into
them. I have almost 100% student attendance in all my lectures.
Due to my primary training as a spacecraft engineer, I have taught all aspects of spacecraft
engineering including orbit mechanics and attitude dynamics as well as spacecraft bus and

10

payload systems (rather curiously, orbital mechanics and attitude dynamics are not requirements
for space engineering qualification according to PEO yet cartography is!). Space technology is
one of the “Eight Great Technologies” (David Willetts MP, Policy Exchange, London, 2013). I
have taught space engineering courses in three universities across two continents including
graduate courses. I believe this has given me some insight into how such courses should be
developed. My spacecraft engineering courses are given from the perspective of designing a
spacecraft within the constraints of mass, propellant, power and data budgets and how those
budgets require detailed analysis to feed into the design. All design decisions must be analysed as
early as possible to prevent mass creep, the bane of the spacecraft engineer. I have written several
textbooks to support my teaching as my experience has been that most textbooks either do not
exist (such as my Introduction to Space Robotics and Planetary Rovers books) or do not offer the
spectrum of skills I believe is necessary for a space engineer (my unpublished Space Technology
for Astrobiology Missions). For instance, electronics in most space engineering textbooks is weak
or non-existent, almost certainly the result of space engineering evolving from aerospace
engineering capabilities in mechanical engineering departments. This is unsustainable – modern
vehicles, be they aircraft or spacecraft, are ever more reliant on avionics (to wit, the vast
expansion of drones in military and civil applications and the advent of autonomous vehicles
about to traverse our roads).
Whilst at the University of Surrey, I was involved in the introduction of a remarkable teaching
tool that I used in my teaching labs to support my spacecraft engineering courses – the EyasSAT
nanospacecraft model spacecraft developed at the US Air Force Academy [Barnhart D,
Vladimirova T, Ellery A, Lappas V, Sweeting M (2006) “Utilising the EyasSAT concept in space
systems engineering courses at the University of Surrey“ International Astronautics Congress,
Valencia, Spain, IAC-06-E1.4.04]. I proposed this teaching tool to Carleton University where it
has been an unprecedented success as one of the defining features of Carleton University’s B.Eng
in Aerospace Engineering with Space Systems course. We have 12 EyesSAT stations in our
undergraduate space engineering lab. The value of practical hands-on training is difficult to overstate – computer simulation and theory are no substitutes for developing practical engineering
acumen, a philosophy that I practice through the extensive assignment of projects in my courses. I
am a great believer that all engineering students should have the opportunity to manufacture
things using traditional and non-traditional tools, especially with the ready availability of 3D
printers. Student response to such opportunities are almost universally positive (though there are
always dissenters disinterested in such opportunities).
One of the most important duties to which we as university professors are bound is the
maintenance of professional standards. In many respects, this is contrary to another duty that is
the treatment of students as customers who are paying for a product (the award of a degree). I
regard my duty to the profession as a higher duty than that to assuage the baser obligations of
commercial interests. There are three types of student – industrious with flexible thinking (who
make good engineers) – industrious but procedurally-oriented (who make good technicians) – and
the indolent (and the worst variant thereof, the barrack room lawyer). The latter I do not tolerate
especially in fourth year when students are about to embark on a profession in which idleness
equates to irresponsibility and, potentially, negligence of which surely the iron ring is meant to be
a reminder (I was greatly privileged to be asked to give a student his ring during the ring
ceremony). The technician mentality also tends to struggle with my teaching style which
emphasises breaking the comfortable bounds of spoon-feeding to which students have become
accustomed – I believe, in the fourth year, that expanding students’ exposure to open problems,
allows them to explore and understand the constraints of time and effort within the bounds of
their own abilities (for many, this exploration of their abilities is a revelation to them).
Furthermore, in my lectures, I provide extensive material and emphasise the most salient topics.

Of course, not all students respond well to this – some want formulae and to work through
example problems ad infinitum without having to exercise much thought. Their goal is passing
exams but education is not just about passing exams. As evidence of the efficacy of my approach,
I frequently have several students wishing to work in my lab during the summer or to do directed
studies under my supervision – I look for enthusiasm with hands-on capabilities (evidenced by
their project assignments) rather than academic prowess (in my opinion, a rarer skill). Several of
them have gone onto graduate studies (not necessarily with me or at Carleton – two of my MASc
students are now at JPL after PhDs from other institutions. I constantly have enquiries about
directed studies under my supervision and volunteers to work in my lab over the summer for
abysmal pay. One MITACS (visiting) student from Tunisia wrote in an email to me: “Hello
Professor Alex, I want to thank you another time for the opportunity of working on such an
interesting project with very helpful and kind teammates and in a very modern lab, and especially
under the supervision of a well known and respected professor of your level. I was always willing
to work on futuristic projects and innovative ideas, that was my main reason for choosing your
project. And even though I didn’t achieve all the objectives we were trying to reach, I am still
very proud to be part of such an interesting project and happy for the work done so far…. “.
As recommended in Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the
New Century (2005) by the US National Academy of Engineering, I place great store on
interdisciplinary individual design projects and including real world case studies within my
courses. For their assessed assignments, I do not give students project ideas but ask them to
propose a relevant project of their own choice within a fluid definition of the course’s scope –
initially, this scares students as they are not used to such freedoms. These fears are exacerbated
because the terms of reference I provide are deliberately vague beyond the guideline that it should
impress me. By opening the scope, students can pursue something that interests them. By not
imposing specific controls, I am not artificially imposing limits on their exploration – this is a
characteristic of planetary missions where there are so many unknowns and little or no previous
human experience. I find that I get the best out of most students this way (the enthusiastic ones
anyway). The most important thing they learn is building confidence in their competence as
engineers and exercising their ingenuity as engineers. I have seen some amazing project results –
all students who have attended my courses reckon they mature in my courses as engineers even if
they have not performed particularly well. I have encouraged my undergraduate students to build
payload instruments themselves (as part of a space instrumentation course I teach) – the most
remarkable instrument was built by a RCAF officer cadet undergraduate who constructed a
working Raman spectrometer (for which I re-imbursed him at $2000 – a bargain when even a
low-end Raman spectrometer costs upward of $12,000). Similarly, for my vehicles course (based
on planetary rovers), I have seen some diverse and fascinating constructions including two ion
engines (which I also have kept) and, most impressively, a working coilgun. Of course, this
approach works most effectively in final year and graduate courses and would not be suitable for
earlier years of undergraduate teaching.
I take the view that engineers are problem-solvers despite their specific training, be it as a
mechanical, electrical or any other type of engineer. We are faced with some of the greatest
challenges that confront our species. As engineers, we must rise to this challenge, for it is from
engineers that solutions will emerge – there is no other profession fit for this task. We cannot
afford to tackle these problems piecemeal – to use a hackneyed political term that so rarely
characterises political ideas, it requires “joined-up“ thinking. We must be grooming the next
generation of engineers to be capable of tackling the big problems that will face their society and
for this they will require broad as well as deep engineering knowledge.

VIII. ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES
In the UK, the general day-to-day administrative load was more taxing than in Canada due to the
centralisation of university administration following Parkinson’s Law [C Northcote Parkinson
(1957) “Parkinson’s Law and other studies in administration” Ballantine Books, New York].
Canadian universities are spared the more irksome burdens of continuous quality assurance,
research reviews, teaching reviews, examination auditing, etc. However, there is the five year
accreditation review by Professional Engineer Ontario for which I am partially responsible for
some of the course content and standards in the B.Eng in Aerospace Engineering stream D (space
systems design). I contributed to the design of this stream and have delivered the core courses for
it which came on-stream two years after I was hired. In particular, I reviewed all the major North
American space engineering courses comparing them to my own experiences at the University of
Surrey, Kingston University, Cranfield University and the International Space University. Indeed,
I was hired at both Kingston University and University of Surrey for new space engineering
courses and had contributed to their design. However, as with all things, the constraints imposed
by the degree structure at Carleton (a fixed year 1 and year 2 syllabi) limited flexibility
necessitating compromises. The students in Aerospace Engineering essentially experience no
aerospace flavour until year 3. However, I believe that the stream D course is comparable to the
best anywhere. At Carleton, whilst a Canada Research Chair (CRC), my recent administrative
load was relatively light to concentrate more on research to compensate for the heavier
administrative and teaching load in my first few years and subsequent to the 10-year CRC term.
Most of my administration involves supervising a research team and a well-equipped space
robotics laboratory. Furthermore, I contribute to wider policy issues within my field of space
engineering such as representing the university at space policy meetings and workshops at the
Canadian Space Agency. I have served on the Departmental Staffing committee (twice) during
the reviewing, interviewing and hiring of new members of staff (2007-2009 and 2022). This was
a heavy administrative load involving ranking applications, attending interviews and consulting
with other staff. One of the key attributes for Carleton is hiring the right person who will fit into
the current team and contribute positively and enthusiastically - being likeable and cooperative
were some of the most important qualifications. I also had until recently, additional
administrative responsibilities such as being a member of the Canadian Foundation for the
International Space University that, on behalf of the Canadian Space Agency, administered and
awarded annual scholarships to the International Space University (ISU) summer school and MSc
degree courses (Space Studies and Space Management) in Strasbourg France. I was on the Tenure
& Promotions Committee in 2017/2018 to gain insights into professorial career development. I

16

have done the rounds of various departmental committees - Aerospace Curriculum Committee,
Dynamics & Controls Curriculum Committee, Graduate Scholarships Committee, Capstone
Projects Committee...These are not roles I particularly relish.
An important part of our responsibility in scientific and engineering research is to communicate
with the public at large who fund our activities and to whom we serve as part of society. I have
been involved in media activities in the UK and Carleton University though its time-consuming
nature has restricted my recent attention to it of late. I am one of the “Experts on Call” on the
Carleton Newsroom that is available for journalists to call for telephone interviews – this happens
on a fairly frequent basis but recently I have scaled my availability back. I have also done a
number of radio and TV interviews in both Canada (CBC) and in the UK (BBC). Some
highlighted examples include a CBC radio interview across four Canadian cities on Mars
exploration (2010), a televised presentation to John Wilkinson then-Minister of Research &
Innovation (2008), a CBC Radio interview on the All in a Day show (2009), a televised interview
on BBC World’s Click (2002), etc. I was recently invited to give a Pint for Science talk in Ottawa
which was rather enjoyable. My more recent activities in this important area of public
engagement has focussed on my current in-progress writing a popular engineering book Manna
from Heaven: How to Save Our Planet concerning the development of in-situ resource utilisation
and self-replication technology for space-based geoengineering and solar power satellites for
clean energy generation. This is part of my general philosophy that engineering is central to
society and that many of society’s ills require engineering solutions.
I believe that engineering has suffered a diminished status since the great Victorian age (apart
from a brief flourishing during the Apollo programme) when engineers were regarded as
visionaries and pioneers. It is essentual to increase public recognition of engineering in society
and enhance engineers’ social status, and recent interest in STEM has gone some way towards
this. Yet the public at large has limited contact with engineers. There is little conception of the
social value of engineering in society compared with doctors, lawyers, teachers and accountants
with whom people have contact in their day-to-day lives. Engineering originated in the trades and
there is a perception that engineers are little more than overly-educated tradesmen. The reasons
for the decline of engineers’ status are many and varied, many citing cynicism towards
technological progress following World War I. Despite the fact that the core of engineering
training is fundamentally mathematics and science supplemented by business, management and
law, scientists are held in higher esteem than engineers [US National Academy of Engineering
(2005) “Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century”
National Academies Press, Washington DC]. One problem is that we engineers do not
communicate our work to the general public as well as scientists – during the Victorian age,
engineers gave public lectures. It is imperative that we communicate to the public to enhance the
social standing of engineering in the community to ensure that the importance of engineering is
understood and valued. Although there has been recent interest in developing strategies to
encourage young people into STEM, these efforts are specifically targeted at the education
system and not society as a whole. Popular science writing and inspiring television documentaries
have been all the rage for a number of years – Brian Cox, Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, Susan
Greenfield and Jim Al-Khalili are a random selection from a host of science popularisers. I am
hard-pressed to think of any academic or industrial engineers who are as well known (only Bill
Nigh comes to mind but he covers science rather than his original trade, engineering). Part of the
problem is that there is little credit to be gained from such activities in academic or industrial
engineering. Nevertheless, it is something in which the engineering community should be
engaged and I believe the brunt of responsibility should lie with academic engineers. The
pressure to sensationalise into “wow-wee” TV can confound and tarnish academic engineers’
reputations however. I have written three recent articles for The Conversation as a step towards

17

public engagement. I have established my credentials through three engineering textbooks – An
Introduction to Space Robotics (2000), Planetary Rovers (2016), and Space Technology for
Astrobiology Missions (unpublished). On that basis, I am currently working on two popular
engineering book titles – Manna from Heaven and its sequel The Tenth Avatar (the latter is
already contracted to Springer Publishers), both of which explore engineering and technology and
their implications for the future. I believe that such popular engineering books will enhance
engineering exposure in broader society.
IX. RESEARCH PROFILE
In this section, I present my publications and research activities in a narrative form. I am a space
engineer whose specialist field is robotics - my research is entirely devoted to space engineering
with an emphasis on robotics in its broadest context. Robotics is a strategic technology for space
exploration [1,2,3,4,5] which covers several specific areas including autonomous exploration
spacecraft [6], on-orbit servicing manipulation [7] and planetary rovers [8] among others. More
recently, I have engaged in a new stream that integrates these other streams in an over-arching
programme of in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) and derivatives cocepts such as self-replicating
machines. I work in all areas of space robotics and I try to tackle difficult core problems rather
than easier peripheral problems. My specialist field – space robotics – is highly multidisciplinary
which offers opportunities for research in a wide span of directions. Indeed, I believe that crossdisciplinary research projects are the richest regions for innovation and enjoy the opportunity to
work at the boundaries of biomimetics and astrobiology in particular. For planetary rovers,
robotics serves the deployment of scientific instruments – this requires close collaboration with
scientists and an understanding of scientific goals. One continually emerging theme across much
of my research is bio-inspiration, which can be appropriate in often subtle ways. I undertook a
long study for ESA on the application of biomimetics to space exploration culminating in reports
of over 1000 pages [9,10,11]. This included a study on a walking robot for Mars exploration [12]
and a bio-inspired drill (addressed later). The main lesson from biology is that it does not carve
up the world into mechanical and control engineering régimes - in biological animals,
morphological structures have co-evolved with their control structures.

I undertook a consultancy project for DRDC on cyber-protection of spacecraft [13,14,15] based on
some of my earlier investigations into hybrid Bayesian network symbol extraction from neural
networks [16]. Because neural nets are not logic-based, they should be immune to logic bombs,
but neural networks are opaque to validation and verufication. Hybridising them with Bayesian
networks offers the potential for incorporating/extracting symbolic logic. If it can be achieved,
this technology can be applied to spacecraft autonomy in FPGA format to impart cyber-immunity
against non-state aggressors yet integrate logic within its weight configuration [17]. This work is
continuing with a cyber-protection private company.
Space Manipulators
I cut my teeth on space-based manipulator dynamics and control and their use in on-orbit
servicing. On-orbit servicing introduces increased spacecraft availability to supplement the use of
high reliability components [18] and offers a potentially commercial application of space robotics
[19]. On-orbit servicing missions can be observed telescopically from the ground with
characteristic observable signatures [20,21,22]. The use of manipulators mounted onto spacecraft for
on-orbit servicing imposes greater complexities in the kinematics, dynamics and control of the
manipulators due to the reaction forces and torques generated by the manipulator(s) on the
spacecraft. During my PhD, I was concerned with the dynamic control of manipulators mounted
onto spacecraft conducting grappling tasks [23]. I developed a method in which the inverse
kinematic equations could incorporate dynamic parameters to accommodate the lack of a ground
reference point by using a locally inertial reference frame (Fig 2) [24]. Linear compensation can
be accommodated through lumped link parameters and the adoption of control moment
gyroscopes for attitude stabilisation. This allowed the use of a Newton-Euler formulation of the
dynamics with a computational complexity of O(n) and the computed torque control algorithm
enhanced with adaptive control gains. During grasping, the reaction moments on the spacecraft
platform are significant requiring the use of control moment gyroscopes rather than reaction
wheels for spacecraft attitude stabilisation [25]. A subsequently published aspect of this work was

Gravity gradient torques may also be exploited to minimise the use propellant [27].

I have also made occasional excursions into propulsion systems for robotic on-orvbit servicers
[28,29]. The same technique [30] was applied to a submersible-based manipulator system with
applications to Europa exploration [31]. This showed the adaptability of the approach to
incorporating fluid constraints on the manipulator dynamics. Although the application of robotics
to astronomy has been considered through the robotic deployment of modular detector arrays [32],
we have applied the same techniques developed for controlling manipulators on spacecraft to the
maintenance of inter-satellite distance to submicron accuracy using manipulator motions without
the expenditure of fuel [33]. This approach will permit the adoption of interferometric
constellations of spacecraft with highly stable virtual platforms to enable high resolution infrared
imaging of extrasolar planets, particularly terrestrial-type planets in the habitable zone of stars
(Fig 3). The same technique can be applied to the detection and measurement of gravitational

During my PhD, it became apparent that the implementation of closed loop force control in
grasping space objects was problematic due to time delays in force feedback yielding instabilities.
We developed forward predictive models to enable visual tracking of scientific targets by rovermounted automated cameras irrespective of the movements of the rover platform. Adaptive
forward models based on neural networks are necessary due to the lack of inertial measurement in
the cameras for feedback (joint sensors only). This is a biomimetic approach based on an ocular
reflex response. We have demonstrated the superiority of this approach on a 7 degree-of-freedom
Barratt arm (Fig 4) [34].

Fig 4. 7 degree-of-freedom Barratt manipulator; manipulator-mounted camera trajectory
without and with feedfoward predictive model
It is known that human cerebellar forward models are capable of compensating for 500 ms time
delays as predictive controllers in geostationary orbit and beyond. We have implemented neural
network-based forward models for controlling space-based manipulators for the acquisition of
large debris pieces [35,36,37]. This involves much more complex forward models than the forward
models used for automated camera control in that they require models which incorporate applied

forces and torques at the end effector. We discovered that it is not feasible to transfer neural
models of terrrestrial manipulators to space-based manipulators despite their similar dynamic
forms so the space-based manipulator required dedicated training [38]. Eventually, we shall
include the implementation of preflexes (modelling the viscoelastic properties of muscles) at the
manipulator joints to provide zero-delay rapid and robust responses. Sigmoid-shaped compliance
can potentially emulate “soft” robots without physical compliant material. This may exploit the
direct drives on the Barratt manipulator eliminating the need for noisy end-effector force/torque
sensing. This three-layer approach to manipulator control – force feedback, cerebellar-like
forward models and viscoelastic compliance – promises a robust approach to manipulation to
overcome the severe limits on manipulation speed for increased productivity rates. This bioinspired manipulator control strategy should enable tactile handling, taping and folding of thermal
blankets and other challenging materials during salvaging of debris spacecraft.
Planetary Rovers
The majority of my research work has been on planetary rovers from traction analysis and chassis
design to autonomous rover navigation. I began investigating Bekker-Wong theory of
terramechanics and its application to Mars rovers. In particular, I explored the performance of the
elastic loop mobility system, a promising pre-stressed concept for tracked vehicles without bogie
wheels for ESA (Fig 5) [39,40,41,42]. I then participated in ESA’s ExoMars Rover Phase A study
and follow-on ExoMars rover studies responsible for several aspects of the ExoMars rover [43]: (i)
traction analysis [44,45] of 19 different chassis designs before selecting the RCL-D chassis [46,47];
(ii) panoramic camera for navigation functions and (iii) optic flow-based navigation.

We also developed a Rover Chassis Evaluation Tool software simulator for ESA with a European
group of partners [48,49,50]. We used this tool and other analytical tools to assess a variety of Mars
rover chassis designs [51,52,53] including ExoMars [54] and legged rovers [55,56,57,58]. Later, I did
some work with MDA Brampton on their LEMUR (lunar exploration manned utility rover)
performing traction analysis and an assessment of autonomous navigation [59,60]. Although
planetary rover development is an engineering discipline, its role in the deployment of scientific
instruments requires an understanding of scientific goals. I was on the science team for the
ExoMars PanCam (led by MSSL) responsible for its design compatibility with a backup
navigation function [61,62]. We benchmarked the computation times for several optic flow

algorithms which were to patch between static map imaging [63,64,65]. During this time, I
investigated the concept of a Mars micro-rover as a post-Beagle 2 successor mission – Vanguard.
Vanguard was based on a 30 kg microrover platform with a highly integrated scientific
instrument suite designed to perform astrobiological measurements [66,67,68,69,70 ,71,72]. This
involved a close collaboration with a small group of scientists (especially Dr David WynnWilliams of the British Antarctic Survey) in developing infrared Raman spectrometers which
could be integrated as part of a multi-instrument suite into the micro-rover [73,74] imposing the
requirement for subsurface drilling beneath the weathered surface layer [75]. The concept of
integrating Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, confocal microscopy and laser plasma
spectroscopy is still of great interest today. The Vanguard design stressed minimisation of robotic
handling of samples so the instrumentation suite was based on non-contact sensors. The adoption
of laser-based instruments was an important design choice as it dictated the planetary surface
operations in eliminating physical sample recovery. Although the Vanguard micro-rover was
subsequently superceded by the ExoMars mission, it was the precursor to the Kapvik micro-rover
which I later proposed to the CSA.
Kapvik is a 30 kg flight-qualifiable end-to-end micro-rover for multiple planetary environments
that was designed with COTS comonents but which requires little modification for flight (Fig 6)
[76,77]. Although administered by MPB Montreal, an optics company with space instrument
expertise but no prior robotics expertise, Kapvik was my concept based on Vanguard which was
developed, designed and built by my research team at Carleton University. Furthermore, it was

from a pre-existing platform. My team’s core contributions to Kapvik were the design and
performance specifications, rover traction analysis, the detailed design, manufacture (in-house)
and assembly of the rover chassis, main electronics box, body structure and all mechanical
elements (except the robotic arm), camera/ultraviolet imager pan-tilt system, the avionics
architecture design including motor controllers, avionics packaging and wiring harness routing,
and adoption of FPGA computers, and much of the autonomous navigation system software
including an unscented Kalman filter for multisensor fusion, vision processing and laser
rangefinder processing.

Kapvik had several key features that I had proposed. The Kapvik arm, although built by our
project partners, was based on my design combining the functions of a manipulator and a camera
mast. The Kapvik chassis is designed to be modular and fully exchangeable to allow different
chassis designs to be implemented including our detailed design for an elastic loop mobility
system (not built) which is likely to be required for more rugged planetary terrains such as the
high priority lunar south pole Aitken basin. The Kapvik chassis is based on an instrumented
wheeled rocker-bogie design [78,79] which incorporated integrated load sensors above each wheel

cohesion and soil friction angle through wheel-soil terrain interaction during rover traverse (Fig
7) [83,84].

Fig 7. Extracted soil cohesion and friction angle during rover traverse at Petrie Island field
trials
This capability was being developed for the online detection of water ice in the lunar regolith
with the NASA RESOLVE mission. This was to be developed into a full capability – SHADE
(soil hazard detection) algorithm – that integrated the above wheel-soil measurements with a
predictive visual component based on wavelet/Gabor analysis within a delayed Kalman filter
framework for the the lunar Resource Prospector mission (RPM) carrying the RESOLVE payload
until it was cancelled in 2016 [85].
We developed autonav algorithms for lidar-based 2D self-localisation and mapping (FastSLAM
2.0) [86,87,88] for Kapvik but tested on our Husky rover platform in field trials (Fig 8). The
FastSLAM technique was augmented by a extended Kalman filter-trained neural network to cope
with the thorny problem of data association [89].

From our 2D FastSLAM algorithms and the current stereovision algorithms, we have developed
stereoscopic vision-based 3D SLAM algorithms for sparse outdoor environments as the basis for
a rover-on-a-chip concept [90]. Path planning algorithms adopted included D* and potential fieldbased approaches - our tailored potential fields to enable threading of the rover through narrow
gaps [91,92,93] (Fig 9) including combined manipulator-rover path planning [94].

delivery to CSA. We achieved this with a budget of only $330k over 2.5 years and at all times,
we were on budget and on time successfully demonstrating the viability of academic delivery of
complex flight hardware and software. Six years after its delivery to the CSA, Kapvik is their
only still-operational micro-rover having undertaken deeper and longer tests than its original
design specification. We have also addressed several issues regarding rover operations in an
underground lunar mine prospecting for buried M-type asteroidal material [95].

Penetrators
My non-robotics space research has primarily focussed on micro-penetrators and impact-tolerant
packages of scientific instruments. At Kingston University and then Surrey Space Centre, the
Vanguard entry descent and landing system was analysed using a software simulation tool that we
developed exploring the use of ballutes (sponsored by SSTL) [108,109,110,111]. Indeed, the
simulation software was used to attempt to localise the landing region of the crashed Beagle 2
probe. I founded the UK Micro-Penetrator Consortium involving SSC, SSTL, MSSL and Qinetiq
in 2002 which now leads penetrator activity in Europe. I had also been involved in the early
phases of the UK’s Subglacial Antarctic Lake Ellsworth (SALE) thermal drilling experiment to
deploy an ice penetrator probe 3 km below the surface ice (I was responsible for the probe’s
internal avionics architecture) [112]. I performed the initial robotic lunar exploration studies for
SSTL which culminated in the UK MoonLite mission concept which incorporated four
penetrators for delivery to the lunar south pole [113,114]. MoonLite has been cancelled and the
European JUICE mission to Europa dropped the penetrator from its payload manifest. At
Carleton, I led the CSA’s internal study on the concept of the micro-penetrator for planetary
exploration which culiminated in a two-day workshop and a visit to the UK to meet the UK’s
Penetrator consortium [115,116,117]. I was appointed chair of the new Canadian Micro-Penetrator
Consortium in 2011 and more recently, we have been working on two penetrator concepts. The
first is a Canadian micro-penetrator with astrobiology instruments based on nanopore technology
led by Magellan. We are explored the use of viffing (vector in forward flight) to define a descent

profile from Saturn orbit of a micro-penetrator [118] to land onto the surface of Enceladus [119] by
measuring the water plume concentration to estimate the water plume structure and target the
geyser source. There are three descent profiles – spiral, nested box and decaying planar
oscillation – each with different Δv (fuel) cost traded against water plume modelling accuracy
[120,121] (Fig 13).

Fig 13. Viffing trajectories - spiral, nested boxes and decaying planar oscillation
SLIM (source localisation and mapping) is a variation on SLAM (self-localisation and mapping)
that locates the source of odours from stochastic Gaussian models of plumes updated by
measurements of vapour concentrations. SLIM can accommodate wisps in a manner that gradient
descent algorithms cannot. We have explored this as the means to target a penetrator spacecraft to
the tiger stripes at the south pole of Enceladus which are the sources of water plumes from a
postulated near-surface ocean [122].
Robotic Science
Mars rover missions are controlled through a 3-4 day communications cycle which is wasteful
and limits the scientific return of these missions – autonomous methods reduce the reliance on the
ground control station. Rover operations are divided into two main phases: (i) traverse of which
autonomous techniques have been described above, and (ii) science data acquisition to understand
Mars and its geological history [123] – this is the province of autonomous science. The firsr choice
for a Mars rover is to select promising sites for astrobiological investigation while respecting
engineering constraints [124]. Kapvik has been deployed in scientific exploration trials such as
magnetometric mapping and methane measurements [125,126,127]. We participated as rover
specialists in Mars Methane rover analogue field trials using EX-DOC at the Jeffrey’s asbestos
mine (that includes serpentine which emits methane) in Quebec with a large scientific team

[128,129,130,131,132,133,134]. The goal was to demonstrate aspects of rover-mediated science data
acquisition in a realistic environment. We have also investigated biomimetic tracking of methane
plumes by a rover to search for the emission sources of Martian methane [135,136, 137] (Fig 14).

Fig 14. Mars methane plume with wisps
The science phase of rover missions may also be implemented autonomously through a robotic
science/astrobiology facility [138,139]. Geological features are of primary interest to planetary
scientists but colour is not used currently as dust covering on rocks on the Moon and Mars makes
colour unreliable necessitating the use of visual texture analysis. We have investigated the use of
Haralick parameters to perform visual texture analysis of rocks [140] then classified them using
Bayesian nets [141]. This has demonstrated an 80% success rate in autonomous classification of
rocks under certain restricted conditions [142]. Haralick parameters were chosen because of their
reliance on entropy and information-based measures of salience that are suited to automated

camera slewing during rover traverses to search for opportunistic targets. This is the imaging
component of active vision to complement our earlier work in feedforward camera control to
foveate on regions of the visual field with high information content but eliminate local minima
with a random component. This would essentially incorporate science acquisition during the
rover traverse [143,144,145] – currently, rover traverses are not conducted with a science acquisition
mode. We have also been examining the use of Gabor filter banks [146] and wavelets [147] which
have demonstrated the ability to track sedimentary bedding formations and extracting folds, faults
and texture analysis of rocks with Bayesian classifiers. Curiously the more sophisticated Gabor
filtering yields only a 70% successful classification rate compared with Haralick parameters. The
Bayesian network must be enhanced to accommodate online learning. To that end, we are
attempting to merge Bayesian networks with neural networks to enhance the performance of the
Bayesuian network through learning [148]. If further developments are successful, it will introduce
greater autonomous decision-making capabilities to rovers augmented by expert-like systems that
can learn to select scientific targets [149]. We have developed two scientific instruments: (i) a
prototype Raman spectrometer for laboratory mineral analysis; (ii) a prototype tuned diode laser
absorption spectrometer (TDLAS) for detecting in-situ water on the Moon [150].

We are also examining the prospect of miniaturising and robustifying this instrument package for
accommodation into an Enceladus penetrator.
In-Situ Resource Utilisation, Additive Manufacturing & Self-Replication
My newest research stream has grown dramatically – in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) and its
ultimate expression, the development of a self-replicating machine. Although asteroids are
attractive targets for the mining of resources [152,153], the Moon offers certain advantages [154]. In
particular, a wide range of metal alloys can be leveraged from lunar minerals [155]. My ISRU
activities began with the MPB Ltd’s LORE (lunar origins and resource exploitation) multispectrometer (UV/VIS/IR) instrument for which my group was responsible for the design of the
shape memory alloy micro-actuators mechanism to control a micro-mirror to steer the optical
signals from a drill-mounted fibre-optic cable. LORE was designed to detect the lunar mineral
ilmenite which represents a potential source of oxygen and iron/titanium alloy (for flight on
JAXA’s Selene-2 but it was not selected) [156,157]. We also designed, constructed and operated an
experimental setup for MPB Ltd to test dust seals on the LORE instrument to ensure that no dust
contamination would occur to any internal mechanisms [158,159]. We were selected as part of the
science definition team for the Canadian contribution to the American RESOLVE (regolith and
environment science with oxygen and lunar volatiles extraction) payload of its Resource

detect water ice in lunar regolith to locate drilling sites. Howeveer, RPM was cancelled.
Expansion into space is hindered by prohibitive launch costs. The current commercial ticket price
to the Moon’s surface is $750k/kg which is prohibitive. The only solution is to industrialise the
Moon using local in-situ resources (Fig 17).

Fig 17. Lunar industrialisation
This cannot be achieved without severing the Earth supply chain. Without industrial
infrastructure transported to the Moon at enormous capital cost, the industrialisation process must
be grown in-situ. The self-replicating machine [160] exhibits two highly desirable characteristics:
(i) its self-replication property gives it exponential growth in productive capacity toward zero
specific cost [161,162,163]; (ii) its universal construction property gives it effectively infinite
productive reconfigurability [164]. The most critical constraints for self-replication are matter,
energy and information closure which impose strict sustainability criteria [165]. The first step to
réalisation of a self-replicating machine is to devise a lunar demandite list of material
functionality [166]. Demandite must be sufficient to construct a generic spacecraft using only
resources on the Moon including buried asteroidal material (Fig 18).

Fig 20. Metalysis FFC process
The extracted purified sintered raw material consitutes feedstock to suites of 3D printers to
manufacture parts, components and systems. 3D printing may constitute a universal constructor
mechanism (which equates to a self-replicating machine) [174,175,176]. Based on von Neumann’s
robotic self-replicator model, we require two fundamental components to realise all mechatronic
systems – vacuum tubes for both computational electronics and some sensors and electric motors
for general actuation. Inspired by the RepRap 3D printer which can print its own plastic parts, we
adopted 3D printing as the central manufacturing technology for universal construction. To
demonstrate universal construction [177], it suffices to demonstrate construction of sensors,
actuators and electronics to realise robotic systems using the lunar material repertoire

Electric motors provide the basis for building an assortment of kinematic machines including 3D
printers and self-assembling systems. We have used of our earlier 3D printed motor versions
(with standard wire coils) to demonstrate simple self-assembly based on a 3D printed TRIGONtype panel [188] (Fig 23).

The next issue is the problem of 3D printing electronic controllers. After discarding printable
polymer-based electronics as a computational medium, vacuum tubes were selected due to the
challenges in manufacturing transistors on the Moon [189]. To reduce the hardware footprint of
Turing-complete hardware based on vacuum tubes, analogue neural networks were adopted as the
basic computational architecture which we have implemented as neural circuitry for controlling a
desktop rover from off-the-shelf components (op-amps) [190] (Fig 24).

We have determined that this architecture can be scaled to address autonomous navigation
through an arbitrary rockfield [191]. We have also successfully implemented the backpropagation
learning algorithm in circuitry [192,193] (Fig 25).

We have yet to 3D print a vacuum tube but have been characterising a macroscopic vacuum tube,
the magnetron for eventual printing. Vacuum tubes also provide the basis for arrays of
photomultiplier tubes augmented with motorised active vision to enhance their resolution [194]
thus completing the sensors-electronics-motor triumvirate of robotics.
We have been developing our in-house high rigidity 3D printer to simultaneously print metal and
silicone plastic – 3D printer is complete with motors, gantry and work bed but the printing and
milling heads are still under development (Fig 26). We have demonstrated the use of Fresnel
lenses to melt aluminium-zinc (to prevent oxidation) using only solar energy and the laying of
alumnium tracks onto silicone plastic substrates demonstrating the principle of simultaneous 3D
printing of aluminium and silicone plastics for both electrical and mechanical applications.

Any lunar infrastructure will require energy resources – solar concentrator-thermionic conversion
for solar energy generation and flywheels for energy storage utilise the same components
required for mechatronics including sensors and motors respectively (an example of exaptation)
[195,196]. One way to exploit universal construction is to build a lunar base using 3D printing
methods [197,198]. As well as habitat construction, some lunar resources can supplement closed
ecological life support systems [199,200]. 3D printing offers sophisticated in-situ medical and life
support [201]. The raison d’etre for industrialising the Moon is to circumvent the launch costs of
building solar power satellites to provide clean energy to Earth [202,203,204,205,206] and, if necessary,
implement space-based geoengineering technologies [207,208,209]. This combined approach could

potentially solve climate change problems in the near and long-term [210]. Human exploration of
Mars is the end goal for space exploration [211,212,213,214]. Self-replicating machines can be sent to
Mars to construct a Martian infrastructure [215]. It also offers an effective solution to asteroid
impact mitigation [216,217]. Finally, it offers the potential for implementing peta-projects on Earth
at low cost [218]. The self-replicating machine introduces some unique biomimetic issues
[219,220,221,222,223] by implementing a uniquely-biological characteristic. In effect, it may be
considered a lifeform that adopts engineering materials rather than organic materials [224,225]. The
threat of uncontrolled replication must be addressed. There are three main approaches: killswitches and error detection and correction coding [226] and the implementation of a cancer
analogue [227]. The self-replicating machine concept has enormous implications for interstellar
exploration [228] and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence [229,230]. It suggests that
extraterrestrial intelligence does not exist [231,232,233].
