ABSTRACT
We consider whether an entire spacecraft can be constructed from lunar resources by
consideration of its materials availability. We first consider what functional materials would be
required to construct all the major spacecraft subsystems. We then examined each lunar mineral
to determine what metals, ceramics, and glasses can be extracted. We suggest that lunar
resources—with certain provisos—can indeed supply all the functional materials required to
construct a spacecraft. We suggest that this could constitute a first generation ISRU capability
and that a subsequent generation to extract KREEP materials would offer enhanced performance
but no significantly greater capacities.
INTRODUCTION
In-situ resource utilisation makes possible the construction of a lunar infrastructure (Steurer
1982). We have developed an inventory of functional materials available on the Moon and
scoped their applications to determine the degree of self-sufficiency attainable without reliance
on an Earth-based supply chain. If we take a long-term view, the decisions made today will
impose legacy effects on future lunar settlers. We must eliminate the Earth-based supply chain
as early as possible to prevent the foreseeable political strife of imbalanced opportunity for selfdetermination for which near-self-sufficiency is a prerequisite. The construction of a lunar
infrastructure such as an evolving Moon Village (even perhaps Lunar University) will require a
range of products – lunar base complexes, closed ecological life support systems including lunar
agriculture, robotic and human-rated rovers, etc – with consumables support – energy, water,
oxygen and other recyclable CNPKS, etc - and machines to implement such constructions –
mining machines, unit (electro/thermo)chemical processors, manufacturing and assembly
machines. Such a Moon Village must be as self-sufficient and self-maintainable as is feasible
without reliance on the extensive Earth-based infrastructure that has evolved to serve Earth.
THE DEMANDITE
We begin with an hypothetical but typical robotic spacecraft comprised of all the major
subsystems as a core requirement for construction from lunar resources on the observation that
all space systems are variations on a spacecraft. This provides us with our demandite concept.
These are the approximate breakdowns for an orbital space vehicle – if we are manufacturing
spacecraft on the Moon, this is a reasonable starting point though a solar power satellite’s design
would be dominated by its energy chain. Similarly, propulsion from the lunar surface includes
launch – we ignore this aspect here other than to observe that launch to the Gateway requires an
LH2/LOX mass fraction of close to 2.5 including tankage. If we are concerned with lunar bases
(Ellery 2021), this table must be interpreted carefully – human-rated spacecraft include extensive

environmental control and life support systems which we exclude from our dry mass allocation.
Terrestrial materials consumption is dominated by bulk civil engineering structures. We might
expect lunar bases to utilise regolith-derived material for compressive structures but these are
primarily conceived as outer shells for radiation /micrometeoroid protection and thermal
insulation. It seems reasonable that inner structure would include metal frames and panels.
Thermal control on spacecraft is primarily passive involving redistribution between short hot
sunlight and cold eclipse cycles - on the Moon, the two-week sun/eclipse periods suggest that
thermal control will be more challenging. A lunar base on the other hand is a static structure
unlike a spacecraft so it requires no GNC/ACS or propulsion. Common features to both lunar
bases and space vehicles that are expected to be approximately similar associated with avionics
- the power system (though a lunar base has fewer restrictions on deployed size), wiring harness,
communications and onboard computing systems. We have adopted a standard 25% for tensile
structure for a spacecraft assuming that additional compressive structure required for a lunar
base would constitute a significant additional mass. Thermal insulation (nighttime) and thermal
radiators (daytime) have been allocated 3% each – for lunar bases, outer regolith protection
offers thermal insulation during both day and night. Thermal straps re-distribute heat internally.
The wiring harness – dominated by electrical power distribution - common to spacecraft and
bases comprises electrical wiring and some electrical insulation (glass fibre) and allocated 8%.
Given that avionics constitutes an increasing fraction of spacecraft and bases or both computing,
control and communications, it is allocated 12%. Mechanical actuation and sensors are allocated
5% each because both spacecraft and lunar bases require orientable mechanisms and sensory
networks – in the latter case, this includes rover/manipulator support. Most spacecraft payloads
are based on imaging systems so we allocate 11% for optical systems – in the case of lunar bases,
this is dominated by mirrors/lenses for thermal ISRU processing. Hard structures and high
thermal tolerance material are also specialized requirements for ISRU processing allocated 3%
and 4% respectively. Hence, ISRU thermal processing systems constitute 18% of the lunar base
mass. Power generation and storage are allocated 20% for both spacecraft and lunar base.

We examine the Moon’s inventory, aware that the Moon is deficient in certain elements,
most notably Cu, Na and halogens. The Moon exhibits a range of resources from volatiles to
regolith to minerals from which useful ceramics, metals and possibly plastics may be extracted
(Appendix). Although volatiles are relatively scarce, careful husbanding of carbon in small

quantities may provide a valuable resource. This defines gaps to realising the construction of
this spacecraft from lunar resources but there are material substitutions that can be made or
strategies implemented to minimise the use of deficient materials, e.g. recycling Earth-imported
reagents so that they are not consumed. A key facet is in the exploitation of multi-functionality
of materials. There are two related issues that must be relegated to future studies and are not
addressed here: (i) the influence of minor natural “contaminants” in minerals which on reduction
will yield contaminant metals in the metal product; (ii) the omission of deliberately added alloy
constituents in product alloys due to their lack on the Moon. Most metal alloys comprise a
majority metal with minor additives such as weldalite, an Al-Li alloy (<2.45% Li) has a low
density of 2700 kg/m3 for lightweight cryogenic structures. Lithium would be challenging to
source from lunar resources (Dreibus et al 1977) so this is not a first generation ISRU option.
High entropy alloys comprise typically five main metals in near equal proportions that form hard
intermetallic compounds, e.g. Cantor (chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel) is tough
at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K) (Savage 2021). Although attractive for lunar pole
environments, the challenges in extracting Cr and Mn from lunar minerals renders this option a
future consideration. One of the primary uses of Cr in alloying is in protection from oxidative
corrosion which does not occur on the Moon. We focus on pure metals and a selection of specific
alloys. We must determine the required relative throughputs for each material based on its use
and determine what are the critical materials with low concentrations.

We do not address all these materials but focus on a few critical ones – both general bulk
and special functional materials. We note that the richest regions with the most varied geology
on the Moon maty be the transitions regions between the anorthosites of the highlands and the
basalts of the mare regions.
LUNAR OLIVINE
We begin with consideration of olivine, a common mineral on the Moon, oft neglected
compared with ilmenite of the maria regions and anorthite of the highland regions. Olivine may
be subjected to Pidgeon reduction at high temperature to yield magnesium metal directly
(Mg2SiO4 + 2CaO → Ca2SiO2 + 2Mg). However, the simplest treatment of olivine is with water.
The olivine fayalite treated with water releases magnetite, silica and hydrogen:
3Fe2SiO4 + 2H2O → 2Fe3O4 + 3SiO2 + 2H2
fayalite

magnetite silica

This yields silica and magnetite as highly useful ceramics, the former for multiple
applications including fused silica glass and the latter for permanent magnets. Furthermore, it
acts as a source of hydrogen which is a useful reductant without mining water. Pyroxenes
(MgSiO3, CaSiO3 and FeSiO3) are also appropriate sources of silica (SiO 2). Hydration of the
olivine forsterite forms serpentine:
2Mg2SiO4 + H2O → Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 + Mg(OH)2

At 332 C, magnesium hydroxide decomposes endothermically to magnesia, one of the two
components of Sorel cement:
Mg(OH)2 → MgO + H2O
The other component of Sorel cement, MgCl 2, can be synthesized by treating MgO with HCl:
MgO + HCl → MgCl2 + H2O

MgO and MgCl2 together constitute Sorel cement which may be used as a binder for 3D
printing of regolith into civil engineering structures, particularly outer protective shielding
(Cesaretti et al 2014). The hydration of olivines offer an alternative route from the Sabatier
reaction - forsterite and fayalite in water at 300 oC and 500 bar converts CO 2 into CH4:
18Mg2SiO4 + 6Fe2SiO4 + 26H2O + CO2 → 12Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 + 4Fe3O4 + CH4

This is the favoured explanation for the existence of methane gas emissions on Mars (Nicol
et al 2018).
LUNAR ANORTHITE
Metals have a wide range of applications due to their specific physical properties. The most
effective thermal conductors are silver and copper but aluminium is a commonly substituted at
low temperatures below 520 oC or so (imposed by its modest melting temperature of 660 oC) with
a thermal conductivity of 235 W/m.K. The most commonly used electrical conductors are copper
and aluminium, the latter being employed in pylon-mounted overhead electrical cables. Hence,
aluminium is a diverse metal that can be used for a multitude of applications – structural metal
in tension as in spacecraft structures, metal electrically conductive wiring, metal thermally
conductive straps, thermal radiator/louvre surfaces and as a constituent of AlNiCo permanent
magnets. An immediate observation is that any spacecraft or lunar base will require a significant
amount of aluminium – some 40-50% of the total dry mass.
The most common lunar minerals are the plagioclases (Ca,Na)(Al,Si) 4O8 of which anorthite
(CaAl2Si2O8) is the commonest. In some highland areas of the Moon, anorthite (calcium-rich
feldspar CaAl2SiO8) comprises >90% of highland anorthosite rock - aluminium enrichment is
up to 33% by mass. Anorthite is highly soluble to HCl acid leaching at low temperature yielding
amorphous silica and alumina with high recovery efficiencies via AlCl 3.6H2O. It is a two-part
process. HCl leaching of anorthite as HCl gas is carried out at 160oC followed by precipitation
and crystallization of AlCl3.6H2O. Silica is removed during this stage by filtration. Removal of
Cl and H2O is achieved by heating at 400 oC which recycles HCl. Roasting AlCl 3 at a maximum
of 900oC for 90 minutes in oxygen yields alumina. Lunar orthoclase may similar be treated with
HCl acid to yield silica and kaolinite. Kaolin – rock bearing kaolinite – is the basis of porcelain.
On Earth, alumina is often extracted from kaolin using HCl leaching (Pak et al 2019) adding
orthoclase as another source of silica and alumina.
Both alumina and silica are refractory ceramics with wide utility especially in thermal control
applications – silica for thermal insulation and alumina for reactor crucible lining. Lime (CaO) can
be reduced to the metal Ca that is more than twice as electrically conductive as Cu – in the vacuum
of the Moon, it will not oxidise. Ca is malleable and therefore offers a source of electrically
conducting wiring. Alumina can also be reduced to aluminium metal. The Washington monument
completed in 1885 was capped with aluminium as an expression of extravagance - aluminium was
an extremely precious metal until the development of the Hall-Heroult electrolytic process in the late
1880s. The low melting point of Al and cryolite permitted the input of liquid solution of aluminum
oxide in cryolite and liquid metal output. For the Moon, the FFC electrochemical process can reduce
both aluminium and silicon independently to high metallurgical purities >99% (Ellery et al 2021). It
is worth noting that aluminium extracted from bauxite requires 227-342 MJ/kg while steel
manufactured from iron ore requires 40-75 MJ/kg (Raabe et al 2019). The FFC process requires
considerably less energy for metal reduction including aluminium as it operates in the solid state. As
well as its desirable qualities as a high specific strength structural material and electrical conductor,

Al powder may be burned in oxygen as a solid fuel or fed as a fluid fuel by a powder pump or auger
but it has poorer performance than hydrogen/oxygen. Silicon has traditionally been earmarked for
solar cell construction but several disadvantages of PV solar cells that render its manufacture and
use marginal (Ellery 2021). It has other uses including as a as a metal alloy additive (such as silumin
with 87% Al and 13% Si). Silicon carbide powder is a versatile material that may be pressure-pressed
at >1400 bar and sintered at around 2000oC but carbon in lunar volatiles is relatively scarce. Silicon’s
primary use is in its oxide form, silica as a source of fused silica glass.

LUNAR ILMENITE
Lunar ilmenite has often been touted as a source of oxygen through hydrogen (or less
commonly carbon) reduction but here we adopt it as a source of iron and titanium: FeTiO3 +
H2 → Fe + TiO2 + H2O. The water is electrolysed to yield oxygen and recycled hydrogen.
Although chemical reduction requires temperatures of 900-1000oC, a temperature of 1600 oC
yields molten iron (liquation) which can be tapped off. Iron offers the basis of many different
functional alloys (steels) and as a constituent of permanent magnets as metal or ferrite. Steel
structures are typically formed from I-beams which impart high stiffness relative to their crosssection area. Silicon steel (up to 3% Si) has dramatically increased electrical resistivity for
electromagnet and motor cores. We have sourced the silicon additive but further additives are
required for other iron alloys Kovar (53.5% Fe, 29% Ni, 17% Co, 0.3% Mn, 0.2% Si and <0.01%
C) is a type of fernico alloy with high electrical and thermal conductivity as a replacement for
copper and/or aluminum conducting wire at high temperatures (such as within vacuum tubes).
We assume that Mn and C can be omitted – Mn is added for fixing oxygen and sulphur at high
temperature to improve malleability; C is added for hardening against malleability. Permalloy
(20% Fe and 80% Ni) offers high magnetic permeability but very low coercivity – the very high
permeability provides magnetic shielding around motor devices to protect adjacent electronics
from stray magnetic fields. We address the sourcing of Ni and Co later. It is worth noting that
for structural purposes, wrought (pure) iron is strong and workable and is not subject to corrosive
rusting on the Moon so stainless steels or zinc galvanisation are unnecessary.
Rutile (TiO2) has uses itself, e.g. FeS2 may form composites with TiO2 to form thin-film
photocatalysts with a large bandgap of 3.2 eV responsive to UV light (Heift 2019). However,
rutile is a source of titanium metal - the FFC electrochemical process was designed to reduce it
into >99% pure titanium (Ellery et al 2021). Titanium has very high tensile strength and
toughness, superior strength-to-weight ratio than steel and aluminium, and excellent corrosion
resistance at high temperature up to 400 oC. The most common alloy comprises 6% Al and 4%
V (Ti6Al4V) and <0.25% Fe which is significantly stronger than pure Ti. Despite its
enhancement of titanium’s corrosion resistance as an additive, vanadium is omitted from medical
applications due to its toxicity suggesting that it’s omission in not a significant issue. Where
combinations of high temperature, lightweight and corrosion-resistance are an advantage such
as reactor vessels, titanium is the material of choice.
LUNAR METEORITIC NICKEL-IRON
As well as local lunar minerals, there are reckoned to be asteroidal resources located in
certain shallow-angle craters including nickel-iron resources (Collins 2012; Wieczorek et al
2012) from which a suite of alloys can be manufactured. Most Ni on Earth is mined as the
sulphide ore pentlandite (Ni,Fe)9S8. Ni is extracted from sulphide ores which is subjected to froth

flotation to concentrate the ore. The ore is then smelted to produce metals which are separated
through solvent extraction. Similarly, Co is in complex mineral compounds such as cobaltite
(CoAsS). Froth flotation concentrates the cobalt minerals followed by roasting which converts
cobalt into its sulphide forms CoS2 and Co2S3. Leaching with sulphuric acid yields Co 3O4 and
CuSO4 solution. Cobalt oxides do not react with hydrogen at elevated temperatures so they are
reduced by smelting with C in a blast furnace. Such processes are unnecessary with meteoritic
nickel-iron alloy. Transition metal carbonyls Mx(CO)y are highly volatile compounds that may
be exploited to yield high purity metal by thermal decomposition (Visnapuu & George 1987).
The metal carbonyl must obey the 18-electron rule offering 9 valence orbitals for metal-ligand
bonding. Ni(CO)4, Fe(CO)5 and Co2(CO)8 are the readily formed from Ni, Fe and Co directly
with CO at 25-100 atmosphere pressure and 100-200oC accelerated by small amounts of H 2S
promoter. The Mond process involves the formation of Ni(CO) 4 at 50-60oC; Fe(CO)5 is formed
at 200oC and 100-300 atm; Co2(CO)8 is formed at 95-110 atm at 120oC. W(CO)6 is formed under
similar conditions to Fe, Ni and Co carbonyls. The Inco pressure carbonyl process allows
simultaneous extraction of Ni, Fe and Co from mixtures at 110-130oC with small additions of
NH3 to improve recovery rates. Ni and Co are used primarily as alloying materials, Ni for heat
tolerance and Co for corrosion-resistance in steels. Nickel is used as electrodes ad grids in
vacuum tubes, as electroplating material and as a catalyst. Cobalt has replaced copper for very
short on-chip wiring which suffers from less electromigration at ultrasmall scales which become
dominant over its superior conductivity.
Invar (64% Fe with 36% Ni) has a low coefficient of thermal expansion (<1 x 10-6/K) for high
precision mechanisms and valves. Inovco (62.5% Fe, 33% Ni and 4.5% Co) has an even lower
coefficient of thermal expansion (0.55 x 10-6/K). Elinvar (59% Fe, 36% Ni and 5% Cr) is nonmagnetic Ni-based steel alloy whose elastic modulus is relatively independent of temperature
making it useful in clockwork movements – Cr is more difficult to extract from lunar resources so
this option is not viable in first generation ISRU. Similar arguments apply to the more complex
nickel-chromium-based superalloys (Inconel such as NiCr15Fe with minor additives) for high
temperature corrosive environments. Fernico is a class of Fe-Ni-Co alloys with good electrical
conductivity suitable for high temperatures (up to 800oC) or cryogenic temperatures (down to 180oC). Kovar (53.5% Fe, 29% Ni, 17% Co, 0.2% Si and 0.3% Mn) is the high temperature fernico
alloy with a low thermal expansion ratio similar to borosilicate glass (6.5 x 10-6/K) so it is used in
glass seals such as vacuum tubes. Mn compensates for brittleness so its omission yields no loss in
functionality. Cryogenic fernico trades a small amount of Co for Ni with 31% Ni and 15% Co, the
rest being the same as the high temperature kovar.
Lunar highland rock is more enriched in tungsten than lunar basalt at an average of 0.3 g/g
but NiFe asteroids are often enriched in tungsten microparticle inclusions – this favours the use
of tungsten in only essential applications. Tungsten has the highest tensile strength and the
lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any metal. Alternative metals are both inferior
(rendering them more challenging to extract) and more rarified (Table 3):

Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal at 3422 oC but it may be melted in liquid
heavy rare earths such as Sc at temperatures under 2150 oC (Dennison et al 1966). This latter
process is clearly not feasible in first generation ISRU. Tungsten is manufactured using powder
metallurgy involving sintering with a cobalt, nickel or iron binder rather than melting. Tungsten
can be joined through spot welding with nickel, brazing with nickel or welded by electron beams.
For electric arc generation in vacuo and X-ray tubes, alloying with <10% Th improves its
ignition but this is not essential. As well as wire filaments, tungsten is used as electrodes in
tungsten inert gas (TIG) arc welders. Tungsten alloys with 22% Rh to improve its structural
properties are typically employed in corrosion resistant, extreme temperature piping and furnace
linings in chemical and nuclear industries. However, the scarcity of tungsten favours the use of
refractory ceramics for high temperature ceramic moulds. Although tungsten carbide WC is one
of the hardest carbides with many applications (cutting tools, high temperature rocket nozzle
steel, etc), its reliance on carbon renders it infeasible. Alumina ceramic may be employed for
these applications. WS2 is a high temperature lubricant that may be substituted for the more
commonly used dry lubricant MoS2. However, silicone oils represent a possible alternative as a
wet lubricant. There is a single use of tungsten that we suggest - W is used as electrodes such as
the high temperature filament in vacuum tubes, electron beam tips, X-ray tube filaments and
interconnects in integrated circuits. Hence, tungsten is essential to permit lunar-sourced active
electronics but if restricted to this application, only small amounts are required.
LUNAR CERAMICS
Most emphasis has been on metals for their excellent tensile properties and their high
electrical and thermal conductivity but ceramics (metal oxides, carbides, etc) have highly
desirable properties such as high temperature tolerance to ~1000-1500oC, high electrical and
thermal insulation properties, resistance to corrosion and high strength (hardness) but they
exhibit poor toughness (brittleness).
The refractoriness and chemical inertness of ceramics lend them to use as reactor crucibles
for melting metals, e.g. Al 2O3. Their hardness permits tooling applications. Steel often requires
the addition of small amounts <2% carbon as the dominant additive. Tool steel (<2% C and 918% W) is durable steel used for cutting tools for low wear (which may be enhanced with the
addition of Cr and W but which will be challenging to extract or scarce). However, carbon is a
scarce resource found in lunar volatiles where it is dominant. Ceramic options are favoured.
Cermet tools comprise titanium carbide and tungsten in a nickel or cobalt binder but carbides
require carbon. A feasible alternative tooling material is high temperature sintered alumina with
high compressive strength, temperature tolerance to 1800 oC and physical properties second only
to diamond. Some ceramics are electrically conducting that exploit their high melting
temperature - ceramic heating elements include the electrically conductive molybdenum
disilicide (MoSi2) and tungsten disilicide (WSi2) with melting points exceeding 2000oC for high
temperature applications up to 1800 oC. To overcome brittleness, glass fibres may be
incorporated into ceramic matrices.
The very high melting point of ceramics renders casting and 3D printing difficult and their
brittleness makes machining difficult. Ceramics are typically processed through thermal sintering
at high temperature. In 3D printing, ceramics are typically processed as ceramic particleimpregnated polymers, through liquid binder jetting of ceramic particles or direct laser sintering
of ceramic particles. Colloidal inks with 40-50% ceramic particle (SiO2 or Al2O3) suspensions in

plastic fluid requires sintering after deposition at 900-1300oC. Siloxanes have been proposed for
non-flammable ceramic-forming electrical insulation (Kopylov et al 2014). The addition of up to
30% ceramic particles (CaSiO3, Al(OH)3, MgO, kaolin, CaCO3 with catalytic iron
metalloorganosiloxanes) into a silicone matrix promotes solidification by thermal sintering at
<900oC. CaSiO3 may be formed from heating at 850oC with SiO2: CaCO3 + SiO2 → CaSiO3 +
CO2. However, the difficulty in the formation of the catalytic additives and the poor strength of
the resultant composites renders this approach untenable. Hence, direct thermal sintering of
ceramic powders offers the most viable solution – indeed, Fresnel based thermal sintering in-situ
regolith may be adopted for the formation of foundations to reduce the dust environment.
Mare basalts contain glasses with high silica and FeO content enriched in potassium. Lunar
regolith may be formed into glass at 1300 oC. Regarding the manufacture of soda lime glass, the
commonest terrestrial glass, the constituent soda (Na 2O) is scarce on the Moon. Furthermore,
the contamination of lunar glasses from iron renders them useless for optical applications
(though basaltic glass in fibre form may be employed as thermal and electrical insulation). This
favours the transformation of pure silica as fused silica glass. Glass is an amorphous vitreous
solid that exhibits a transition from a hard, brittle state to a viscous state. It is a durable
transparent material that is resistant to chemicals, heat up to 1000 oC and mechanical stress. For
use as optical fibres, a means to incorporate internal reflection must be devised – this is usually
through an internal gradation of refractive index between the glass/plastic core and glass/plastic
cladding. It is plausible that metallic cladding of nickel or cobalt might be employed (Klainer et
al 1991). Amplification of light signals within an optical fibre may be achieved by doping the
silica of the fibre by the rare earth element erbium. This can be pumped by a diode laser to emit
stimulated photons at higher power. The use of chalcogenide glasses containing elements from
group 16 (such as S) allows the fibre to act as a resonating cavity. Although S is available from
lunar/asteroidal resources, rare earth element availability relegates optical signal processing
from first generation ISRU. Reinforced glass may permit use as a structural material - alkalialuminosilicate “gorilla” glass is toughened through ion-exchange by immersion in a molten
alkaline potassium salt bath at 400 oC. Replacement of sodium ions (soda glass) by larger
potassium ions in the surface layer generates high residual compressive stresses increasing its
strength. It is unclear if fused silica glass can be strengthened in a similar manner.
LUNAR PLASTICS
Plastics are mouldable lightweight hydrocarbon-based materials that are highly versatile but
their specific unique properties are their use as flexible insulation (elastomers). Elastomers are
used for seals and gaskets, shock and vibration mounting and flexible connections such as
electrical insulation, expansion joints, transmission belts and fluid hoses. The radiation
resistance of epoxides is higher than other polymeric resins due to the presence of benzene ring
structures. Synthetic rubber such as styrene-butadiene was developed during to World War 2
when Axis forces gained control of natural rubber supplies. Common rubber replacement
synthetics include polybutadiene (CH 2-CH=CH-CH2)n used in tyres. For space use,
polyethyleneterephthalate (PETE) is the core polyester in Dacron fibre and Mylar film. Its
versatility is illustrated in Spectralon, a translucent polymer constructed from compressed and
sintered tetrafluoroethylene powder for use in diffuser optics. Plastic is usually injection
moulded in which the plastic is automatically injected into a closed cavity under heat. Trimming
may be accomplished by reducing the temperature below its glass transition temperature and

bombarded with beads to remove excess material. Alternatively, a lathe may trim away excess
material. Fused deposition moulding is an extrusion-based 3D printing technique has become
common for constructing thermoplastic structures (Jones et al 2011). However, plastics require
a dependable source of carbon and hydrogen, the former of which is not plentiful on the Moon.
Silicone plastics reduce the amount of carbon required by adopting a O-Si-O backbone so
only the side chains require carbon. Silicone rubber is an elastomer of silicone which is stable to
high temperatures up to 300 oC and UV radiation-resistant. It is a highly adhesive gel uncured
forming a solid in its cured or vulcanised state. They may be one-part or two-part polymers and
may contain fillers. Glass fibre and iron oxide powder fillers offer high thermal tolerance an d
high thermal conductivity respectively yet retaining electrical insulation. Room-temperature
vulcanised silicone is a one-part system in which silane is cured by crosslinking through
hydrolysis by exposure to water at room temperature. Cured silicone is an effective sealant and
adhesive. Polyorganosiloxanes added to platinum-cure silicone mixtures constitutes an adhesive
(Lin et al 2013). There are other non-carbon backbones that may be exploited. Ferrocene
Fe(C5H5)2 is an organometallic sandwich compound formed by the cyclopentadiene with Fe at
350oC: Fe + 2C5H6(g) → Fe(C5H5)2 + H2(g). Metalosiloxane polymers based on alternating Si-O
and Al or Ti (such as aluminosiloxanes) may be produced by hydrolising metal siloxanic
compounds. Such “plastics” are stable to temperatures above 300oC. Aluminosiloxane with AlO-Si backbones - Al(O’Pr)2(OSiMe3) - may act as an organic precursor to a transparent
refractory ceramic (92Al 2O3-8SiO2) via gelation followed by heat treatment (Pouxviel et al
1987). Aluminosiloxane is synthesised through transesterification of cyclohexane with
trimethylacetoxysilane: Al(O’Pr)3 + yMe3SiO(CH3CO) → Al(O’Pr)3-y(OSiMe3)y +
y(CH3CO)O’Pr where y=1-3. Similarly, titanosiloxanes have Si-O-Ti backbones (Davis &
Murugavel 2005). Unfortunately, these precursor materials require complex chemical
processing. Prior to the invention of plastics, the only mouldable materials were natural rubber,
glass and wet clay that hardened into brittle ceramics. In fact, prior to plastics, porcelain was
used as electrical insulation but the use of glass cloth offers a flexible insulation solution. Lunar
plastics may be dispensed with.
LUNAR MAGNETIC MATERIALS – A FUNCTIONAL MATERIAL FOR ACTUATION
If electric motors can be constructed from lunar resources, machines can be built in-situ, i.e.
machines of production, the basis of a self-sustaining industrial infrastructure. Permanent
magnet motors are more compact than magnetic induction motors so DC/AC electric motors
require permanent and soft magnets.
Iron core is the most traditional soft magnetic core material for its a high magnetic capacity
and a relatively high magnetic permeability. It has significant magnetic capacity of 1.3 T. As Fe
is an electrical conductor, it will conduct eddy currents. Heat is generated by the flow of eddy
current which imposes limits to tolerance. At high temperatures, permanent magnets lose their
magnetic strength - iron loses its magnetism above 600oC. The addition of 3% Si to iron forms
silicon steel (with a magnetic capacity of 1.6 T) which reduce eddy currents by increasing
electrical resistance. The addition of Cr to form FeSiCr (3.5% Si and 4.5% Cr) further improves
soft magnet performance but this option is not feasible for first generation ISRU. Eddy currents
are also minimised with laminations into which electrical insulation is embedded. The insulation
used is typically polyamide, polyurethane or other insulation. Most insulation is limited to a
maximum of ~125oC with polyurethane being rated up to 120oC. Current-carrying copper wire

is wound around the iron core. The coil of wire around the core generates the applied magnetic
field when a DC passes through the coils. The higher the number of coils, higher the magnetic
field generated. Typical wire coil insulation is enamel or cotton-insulated wire but modern wire
is commonly coated in polyester, polyurethane or other insulator. Glass laminations and glass
cloth respectively may offer options for lunar-derived motors. Ferrite is an iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3
- rust) ceramic that is chemically bound to another metal to form MFe 2O4 where M=divalent
metal cation. Ferrite is electrically resistive but ferrimagnetic. Soft ferrites have low coercivity
(easy to demagnetise) for ferrite cores, e.g. NiFe 2O4. Ferrites are typically manufactured through
a series of procedures (Bhalla et al 2012) which can be adapted readily to lunar conditions: (i)
metal oxides are mixed in water and dried at 150 oC; (ii) powders are calcined (pre-heated in air
at 75% sintering temperature ~900oC); (iii) powders are ball milled to ensure particle size ~5-15
µm; (iv) powders are mixed with a binder, lubricant and water to form a slurry which is sprayed
with hot air into granules; (v) the granules are pressed into components in a mechanical or
isostatic press with a pressure of 100-150 MPa; (vi) pre-sintering in a furnace up 800 oC in air to
evaporate binder and other impurities, then sintering to 1000-1300oC in inert gas to prevent
oxidation (unnecessary on the Moon); (vii) component shrinks by 15-20% and surface machined
by grinding with a hard ceramic wheel with water cooling. Traditional ceramic magnet
manufacture is through casting because selective laser sintering/binder jetting yield porous
structures. Ceramic ferromagnets such as soft ferrites (NiFe2O4) have been fabricated from metal
oxide powders (NiO/Fe2O3) through extrusion-based freeforming (EFF) followed by high
temperature solid state reactions (Peng et al 2017). EFF (robocasting) involves deposition of a
ceramic paste through an orifice, the size of which determines the print resolution. The metal
oxide powder <1 µm size was suspended (34-35% powder) in water containing polyvinyl alcohol
as a binder, polyethylene glycol as a plasticiser and dispersant to obtain high fluid viscosity
within the range 10-100 Pa.s. The paste was extruded using a standard fused deposition
modelling 3D printer to construct objects layer by layer. Heating beyond 350 oC evaporates the
water then the organic material was burned off. Following printing, sintering above 1300oC for
60 h yields dense microstructures of ferrite with minimal porosity due to diffusion and grain
growth but with 20% shrinkage yet retention of shape. The solid state reactions that occurred
during sintering is given by: NiO + Fe2O3 → NiFe2O4. The magnetisation increased with
sintering temperature to a maximum at 1350 oC of 48 emu/g for soft magnet nickel-iron oxide.
Structures printed included mesh, helical gear, ring and cylinder structures. These techniques are
potentially applicable to other ferrites such as CoFe 2O4. For the Moon, the binder might be
substituted with clay which also doubles as a plasticiser.
The stator permanent magnets have commonly adopted iron and ferrite (Fe2O3) though their
magnetic densities are modest. Hard ferrites have high coercivity (hard to demagnetise) for
permanent magnetic stators, e.g. BaFe 12O19 (maximum magnetic field capacity of 0.35 T).
Barium is not feasible to source on the Moon so hard ferrites are not an option. Cobalt ferrite
CoFe2O4 is a semi-hard ferrite that may be substituted which also has magnetostrictive
properties. Fe-Co has the a high induction rating at saturation of 2.2 T (with Tc =940 oC). Ferrites
may be formed through heating a mixture of the metal oxides (CoO and Fe2O3) to high
temperature and pressed into a mould. As well as hard ferrites, more powerful ferromagnetic
materials include iron-cobalt alloys, samarium-cobalt, alnico-iron alloys and rare earth magnets.
Ferrous AlNiCo (aluminium-nickel-cobalt) alloy magnets double the magnetic energy density
from iron and ferrites. Ferrous-AlNiCo (35% Fe, 35% Co, 15% Ni, 7% Al, 4% Cu and 4% Ti)
alloys are hard magnetic materials usable up to 540 oC with Tc=850oC with a coercivity of 50

kA/m. They were commonly used in high torque motor applications prior to the development of
rare earth magnets. Rare earth elements offer compact permanent magnets for their high
magnetic fields. The first rare earth magnets were SmCo alloys Sm2(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)17 which
further doubled magnetic energy density from AlNiCo. They are usable up to 300oC with
Tc=720oC offering a coercivity of 160-240 kA/m. The highest magnetic field capacity is offered
by rare earth magnets of NdFeB alloys – they comprise the rare earth element Nd with Fe and B
and small amounts of the rare earth element dysprosium offering a high field coercivity of 300450 kA/m. However, the superior NdFeB alloys are usable up to only 140oC with Tc=310-400oC
(α=-0.0012/oC). If the maximum temperature rating of the permanent magnet is exceeded,
demagnetization will occur. The maximum temperature rating for SmCo (α=-0.0004/oC) is
300oC and AlNiCo (α=-0.0002/oC) is 540oC. Given the material limitations on the Moon and the
high temperature tolerance of motors required, AlNiCo permanent magnets are favoured for
lunar construction assuming that Cu component can be omitted without major loss of function –
Cu is typically added to improve ductility which may be unnecessary if 3D printed.
Permalloy comprises 20% Fe and 80% Ni though 45 permalloy comprises 55% Fe and 45%
Ni – it offers an even higher magnetic permeability of 100,000 and is used in transformer
laminations over silicon steel. Variations include supermalloy (79% Ni, 16% Fe and 5% Mo)
which offers a very high magnetic permeability of 800,000 and excellent soft magnetic
properties. Magnetic shields are not usually necessary for electric motors but may be used in
photomultiplier tubes and electron guns to prevent stray magnetic fields from deflecting the
electron beam. For radiofrequency magnetic fields above 100 kHz, magnetic shielding is
implemented by electrically conductive screens - Faraday shields. Faraday shields are metal
mesh or screen enclosures to block electric fields by distributing electric charges to cancel
interior electric fields. They are ineffective against low varying magnetic or static magnetic
fields <100 kHz. The holes of the mesh must be much smaller than the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to be shielded such as radio waves.
Amorphous metallic glasses are formed when the complex molten alloy – including the LnAl-TM family such as Al90Fe5Ce5 and La55Al25Ni20 - is cooled rapidly at ~105-106 K/s to prevent
crystallisation (Greer 1995). This can be accomplished through melt spinning – molten alloy is
sprayed onto the rim of a rapidly rotating wheel. They are brittle but there do exist high tensile
strength species such as Al88Ni9Ce3Fe1. They possess soft magnetic properties with very low
coercivity and but poor magnetic saturation. Fe-Co-based magnetic glasses – Fe36Co36B19Si5Nb4 exhibit superior magnetic softness than silicon steel and much lower power losses (Lesz 2017) but
require exotic materials. Fe-based bulk metallic glasses such as those based on FeB alloy (Fe80B20,
Fe78B12Si10, etc) have soft magnetic properties with high saturation magnetisation of 1.3 T with
applications in electromagnetic actuators (Suryanarayana & Inoue 2013). The simpler Fe-based
metallic glass Fe80P13C7 may be manufactured from raw Fe steel and FeP alloy through combined
fluxing and J-quenching. It has high fracture strength has good soft magnetic properties with a
saturation magnetisation of 1.4 T and low coercivity at 7.2 A/m (Ling et al 2015). However,
metallic glasses require boron or carbon making them infeasible for lunar use. The discovery of
Fe-based high temperature superconductivity offers promising applications (Beasley 2013). High
temperature superconductors such as BSCCO and REBCO can create high magnetic flux >23 T in
large electric motors to reduce their dimensions (Maeda & Yanagisawa 2014). High temperature
superconducting wires for winding coils such as YBCO cooled to 25 K can generate current
densities of 200 A/mm2 (Frauenhofer et al 2006; Smitchler 2010). However, these are also beyond
lunar resources but may be a future option for lunar electromagnetic launchers.

CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that all the major functional systems of a spacecraft can be sourced from
lunar resources. We will require a new design philosophy that emphasises maximum utilisation
of resources rather than optimal energy efficiency or minimum mass as adopted in traditional
spacecraft design. In particular, we examine the notion of sourcing material required to construct
electric motors which constitute the key component for building manufacturing machines. This
also appears feasible. The option for a second generation of ISRU technology suggests that
accessing KREEP minerals will yield greater performance to functional systems but no radical
new capabilities from the first generation.
