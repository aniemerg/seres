Abstract—Robotic industrialisation of the Moon at minimised cost will require the exploitation of local resources through universal
construction. Universal construction implies the automatic construction of robotic machines of production from raw material. A key
component of universal construction is additive manufacturing (colloquially, 3D printing) which is capable of manufacturing highly
sophisticated structures. To demonstrate that 3D printing constitutes universal construction, we must be able to 3D print the
mechatronic triad components of robotics – actuators, sensors and controllers, i.e. 3D print robotic machines of any kinematic
configuration. One such configuration is the cartesian robot of which the 3D printer is a type. We have demonstrated that one of these
three basic elements of robotic machines – the electric motor – can be 3D printed. We regard this as a major step towards implementing
universal construction and, by proxy, self-replicating machines.

The Moon is the target for many nations with a common goal to support both human and robotic missions in building a
permanent lunar infrastructure. The “Moon Village” is envisaged as a collection of government, scientific and commercial assets on
the lunar surface. The chief barrier to space exploration has been the cost of launch from Earth to the destination, be it the Moon,
Mars or elsewhere. To reduce the cost of launch, we can utilise resources already out there. Such in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU)
of local resources will be essential to support human habitation on the Moon to reduce costs of supply from Earth. Most effort has
focused on sourcing consumables such as propellant (hydrogen) and oxidiser (oxygen) from water ice condensed in the polar
regions of the Moon. There are ethical concerns over the sustainability of burning such a scarce resource. Rather than a piecemeal
approach to resource utilisation, we propose a principled approach to expressly pursue the construction of infrastructure on the
Moon using the Moon to minimise the cost of transport of assets to the Moon. Such extraterrestrial industrialisation of the Moon
will require the deployment of different robotic machines of production (Fig 1).

To that end, we have introduced the concept of a lunar industrial ecology for efficient extraction of resources of the Moon to
provide demandite, a list of desirable functional materials for the construction of a spacecraft that can be sourced from the Moon
(Table 1) [1,2]. It is the embodiment of a circular economy [43]: (i) minimise the flow of material – both variety and amount required to build products (its output=itself); (ii) build products with durability and repairability for long life (self-repair is a subset
of self-replication); (iii) recycle products at end of life by enabling separability of constituent ingredients (simple ingredients); (iv)
regenerate material for new uses to prevent pollution by waste (recycling). As the backbone of this industrial ecology, we have
demonstrated in the laboratory, the extraction of aluminium metal from lunar highland regolith simulant rich in anorthite [44,45].

We are currently investigating the use of 3D printing (additive manufacturing) to convert these materials into useful products,
demonstrating that manufactured parts can be built using a short processing sequence from raw material to final product.
Nevertheless, we still require the launch and installation of machines of production on the Moon to build any infrastructure on the
lunar surface. To obviate this problem, it is necessary to leverage the mining, processing and manufacture of such machines from
lunar resources. We have the classic chicken-and-egg situation – we must launch such machines of production to the Moon to build
such machines of production. We explore an efficient approach to robotic lunar industrialisation that circumvents the problem of
launch costs by manufacturing its entire infrastructure from lunar resources. In this approach, we deploy self-replicating machines

to the Moon to build copies of themselves to grow their population. Each self-replicating machine is a lunar manufacturing factory
capable of copying itself. In effect, we amortise the initial capital cost of launching the first self-replicating machine from Earth
over an exponentially growing productive capacity on the Moon [6]. The Staley economic model of self-replicating machines
assumes a Darwinian selection of businesses in which low productivity businesses are selected out yielding productivity growth –
self-replication is thus an accounting concept rather than a physical process as presented here [46]. A self-replicating machine is a
machine comprising capital goods but no labour that replicates its capital goods autonomously. We suggest that it can only be
subject to obsolescence (and so depreciation) when a new improved machine is uploaded – it spawns its own successor. The idea of
a self-replicating machine on the Moon is not new – it was first proposed (and subsequently shelved) in the 1980s [4] but new
leveraging technologies have emerged since rendering the self-replicating machine concept feasible [5].

A simplified version of an autonomous self-replicating Lego robot comprised of six modules in which the replicating robot selfassembles its modules into a growing structure [47]. Module 1 comprised batteries, a touch sensor and a contact sensor; module 2
comprised a finite state machine and contact sensors; module 3 comprised a left motor and a motor drive circuit; module 4
comprised a right motor and a barcode reader; module 5 comprised a relay circuit; and module 6 comprised a tracking sensor. The
robot possessed three simple behaviours – forward line-tracking, reverse and left turn - to run a circular circuit guided by a black
line around a pre-structured environment with modules placed at specific locations. It required both a complex set of modules and a
structured environment limiting the adaptability of the self-assembly scheme. This work was akin to a physical instantiation of lowcomplexity replication without universal construction. This was a self-assembling system rather than a self-replicating system.

To that end, we are interested in building a universal constructor - a machine that, given the appropriate resources (material,
energy and information), can construct any machine, including a copy of itself. The key to the universal constructor to exploit its
versatility through its reconfigurability [48]. According to von Neumann [7], an abstract self-replicating machine comprises four
functional systems: (A) a universal constructor (modelled as a robotic arm) that builds any machine specified by a program of
instructions D; (B) a copying machine that can copy the program of instructions D; (C) a universal computing machine (modelled
as a set of logic gates) that controls A by reading D for implementation and B for reading D for copying; (D) a program of
instructions that may specify any machine including itself (A+B+C), i.e. a self-replicating machine. From von Neumann’s model,
universal construction is a sufficient (but not necessary [8]) condition of self-replication. The universal constructor is in essence a
set of robotic machines that manipulate its environment according to its instructions., i.e. the universal constructor constitutes a
suite of robotic machines to convert raw material into specified robotic products that may include load-haul-dumpers, conveyors,
ball mills, pumps, 3D printers, manipulators, etc. All the major physical acquisition and processing techniques required to convert
raw material into products require actuators. Other than structure, the essence of all these robotic machines are mechatronic
components – sensors, actuators and control systems. They are kinematic machines in that they are different kinematic
configurations of motors each controlled by electronic circuits using feedback from sensors. The centrality of motor systems to the
universal constructor/self-replicating machine is clear.

Fig 2 is a schematic that encapsulates the critical importance of electric motors and their controllers to the self-replication
process. The red arrows follow the same production sequence as Fig 1: a rover with a scoop to excavate lunar regolith which is then
processed mechanically and then (electro)chemically into feedstock that is 3D-printed. From this, the 3D printer(s) prints
mechatronic components (represented here as an electric motor and an analogue neural network circuit). In its universal
construction capacity, these comprise crucial components of any product machine, in this case, a small spacecraft with avionics and
reaction wheels. The yellow arrows indicate that the motor and electronics are central components to its production machines –
rover vehicle and its outboard equipment, mechanical processing/beneficiation, pumps to drive unit chemical processors and the 3D
printer itself.

ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING

A central component of the universal constructor (and, by implication, a self-replicator) is a generalised additive manufacturing
facility representing a versatile, efficient and powerful technique of manufacture [9]. Additive manufacturing (colloquially, 3D
printing) is different to traditional subtractive manufacturing such as casting, forging, turning, milling, etc. It can manufacture
complex geometries in a single location unattainable through milling or other methods (Fig 3). 3D printing employs zero tooling
and generates very little material waste compared with traditional subtractive machining. 3D printing technology aids in observing
the matter, energy and information closure constraint between generations necessary for self-replicating systems [3]. To ensure
maximum efficiency of the universal constructor, our intent is to minimise non-3D printing processes that impose significant
infrastructure and energy costs, e.g. casting into moulds, forging using compressive dies, joining activities, etc. The RepRap 3D
printer is an exemplar of an extrusion-based 3D printer in that it was capable of manufacturing some of its own structural (plastic)
parts [9], i.e. partially self-replicating (Fig 3).

Figure 3. RepRap 3D printer capable of printing its white plastic structural components

The RepRap 3D printer, like many 3D printing machines, is in essence a cartesian robot, and, indeed, the universal constructor
has been envisaged as a cartesian robot assembler [10]. The cartesian (or delta) form of 3D printer may be converted into such an
assembling system by replacing the 3D printing nozzle with a three degree-of-freedom wrist. Self-replication of a 3D printer
requires the ability to 3D print all the parts that constitute itself. All robotic machines are in essence kinematic configurations of
feedback-controlled actuators, the 3D printer being a cartesian configuration of DC electric motors.

rin

Our hypothesis is that if we can 3D print an electric motor system, we have progressed significantly towards a universal
construction capability. A major leap towards such a universal constructor would be a demonstration that motors, electronics and
sensors can be 3D printed within a single module of a self-assembling system [11]. In-situ manufacture of robotic systems requires
the manufacture of electric motors, electronics and sensors. The universal constructor is a robotic system implying that realisation
of the self-replicating machine requires self-construction of mechatronic components from feedstocks. Here, we shall consider only
electric motors – sensors and computational electronics as the second and third components of the mechatronic triumvirate are
considered elsewhere [12,13]. We briefly review actuators and attempts to 3D print them, primarily as smart materials, and find that
DC electric motors have yet to be 3D printed in their entirety until the work presented here.

Smart materials are programmable matter as they can behave replicably and reversibly according to different stimuli by
executing stored programs as shape memory [63]. This includes electrorheological and magnetorheological fluids, ferrofluids and
shape memory materials often in conjunction with elastomers. Programmable matter integrates sensing and actuation into the
control of physical material shape as the embodiment of a computer program. Computation is thus a reversible physical process in
programmable matter. Smart materials are artificial muscles that are the basis of soft robotics premised on variable stiffness
actuation. A comprehensive review of artificial muscles is given in [14]. A variable impedance module with variable stiffness and
damping may supplement a DC motor and gearing [49]. There are several artificial muscle candidates – McKibben actuators that
use compressed air to generate high forces; shape memory materials whose small strain may be amplified by coiled spring
geometries; dielectric elastomer (such as silicone) and ionic polymer metal composite actuators which require high voltage but offer
low stress. The silicone PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) is overwhelmingly the most popular elastomer for its stretchability with high

thermal stability and resistance to chemical and radiative insult, e.g. Ecoflex. Shape memory alloys (SMA) memorise their original
form when thermal stimulus is applied [56]. By far the most prevalent is NiTi alloy which is more stable and higher-performing
than iron-based or copper-based SMAs. NiTi alloy exhibits both shape memory (Ti>Ni) and superelasticity (Ni>Ti) in response to
strains due to solid transformations between its martensitic and austenitic phases. When heated, the lower temperature martensitic
phase transforms into the higher temperature austenitic phase. There is an austenitic-start temperature As at which contraction
begins that is completed by the austenitic-finish temperature Af. On cooling, reversion to the martensitic phase starts at the
martensitic start temperature Ms and is complete at the martensitic finish temperature Mf. The shape memory effect is hysteretic as
the transition temperatures are different between heating and cooling
~20-40oC typically. Actuation is the reversible
transformation from martensitic to austenitic phases through the application of thermal energy. Wire can be coiled into a spring
which increases stroke but lowers actuation force as tension is converted into shear. 4D printing refers to 3D printed structures that
can alter their shape subsequent to printing on stimulation, i.e. 3D printed smart structures [66]. Three air-cooled SMA wires in
series with a linear spring fixed to a cam generated rotary motion at 0.2 Hz [57]. A rotary actuator was constructed, driven by six
SMA wires arranged radially within a flexspline. Activation of opposing pairs of SMA wires sequentially drove the flexspline
within the outer gear wheel [57]. NiTi shape memory alloy powder mixed in thermoplastic binder has been extruded into shape
memory functional 3D printed actuators [58]. NiTi alloy has been additively manufactured into complex structures unachievable
through traditional powder metallurgy using powder-bed additive manufacturing (such as selective laser sintering or melting)
and/or directed energy deposition requiring a minimum energy density of 200 J/mm3 [50]. Laser input energies of 155-292 J/mm3
offered melting for optimal part densities with high tensile strength of 776 MP and 5% recoverable strain [59]. Selective laser
melting of NiTi has fabricated complex trusses and lattices with controllable elasticity for vibration suppression [60]. Selective laser
melting of NiTi alloys has created inchworm-based crawling robots actuated by an SMA spring actuator [61]. Smart polymer
materials that can be 3D printed offer promise of 3D printed robots. PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) is suitable for fused
deposition modelling and has been 3D printed to form cam shafts for opening and closing of valves [64]. PEEK (poly(ether ether
ketone)) is a high temperature-tolerant shape memory polymer that can be trained at room temperature to induce a residual strain of
30% [65]. Smart material polymer actuators may be 3D printed within a silicone matrix. Different types of silicones can be 3D
printed with differential properties to yield shape-shifting multimaterial bilayers [70]. A simple robotic arm with rigid PLA with
integrated polyurethane pneumatic actuators was printed by a single multi-material fused deposition modelling printer by switching
between printing tools [51]. Both materials were thermoplastics. A polyurethane pneumatic chamber embedded within an FDM
printed finger measured the pressure (volume) change induced by touch contact adding touch sensing to pneumatic actuation [52].
A PI controller used the feedback to alter actuation force in real-time. Ionic polymer metal composites may be 3D printed in
precursor form and then electro-activated through hydrolysis in potassium hydroxide and dimethyl sulphoxide aqueous solution
followed by metal plating. Smart materials can typically be used as actuators or sensors. For tactility, actuation is tightly correlated
with stretchable tactile sensing for measuring actuator deformation [67]. Direct ink writing was employed using two viscoelastic
inks – an ionically conductive hydrogel and an insulating silicone – that were extruded from separate nozzles and then
photopolymerised into stretchable capacitive pressure sensing “skin” to measure elastomeric actuation [68]. However, hydrogels
often suffer from slow response rates. Emerging tactile sensing technology may be combined with vision-based methods to detect
actuator deflection [71]. Although commonly used as sensors, piezoelectric motors use piezoelectric material to generate cyclic
mechanical motion by the application of an electric field and are magnetic field-immune. Similarly, ultrasonic motors use resonance
to amplify the vibration of a piezoelectric stator to drive the rotor. For example, 3D printing of bidirectional (forward and inverse)
piezoelectric systems comprised of 3D network of struts may be used to create actuating structures with proprioceptive feedback
control [15]. High resolution microstereolithography used UV-photocurable methacrylate co-polymer networks to 3D print shape
memory polymers with higher strains than achievable otherwise [69]. These are examples of metamaterials, synthetic architectures
of 3D printed repeated patterns that generate specific functional properties [16]. Such approaches to soft robotics suffer from
limited utility. Despite the promise of smart materials as actuators, they do not provide the combination of stroke and torque
magnitude that electric motors provide. We have illustrated this limitation of poor stroke and low frequency of actuation by smart
materials in a rotational implementation of artificial muscles using NiTi shape memory alloy wire (Fig 4). A simple three-SMA
wire rotary motor was constructed, each wire mounted onto cams that were excited sequentially to turn the rotor (Fig 4a). The
lengths of the SMA wires had to be long enough to provide sufficient stroke to turn the rotor limited by NiTi’s low strain capacity
(Fig 4b). Furthermore, thermal dissipation limited the rotary frequency to ~1 Hz.

One option to increase stroke and frequency is to drive an inflatable elastomer with a 3D printed micro-internal combustion

All so-called 3D printed motors to date, when scrutinised, have not been fully 3D printed but only partially 3D printed. The
closest to a 3D printed motor concept was a pancake DC motor with a dual PCB layer pancake rotor with etched copper coils and
two pancake stators with a circumferential array of permanent magnets [20]. It was constructed through conventional means but
presented the idea of 3D printability. Structural aspects of the stator and rotor of an axial flux motor have been 3D printed before
[34] and printed pancake motor rotors are well established [35]. Photolithographically-printed copper wiring on the epoxy-glass
laminate stator is parallel to the rotor which carries alternating currents to generate rotor spin. Alternatively, the flat current winding
is etched onto a flat armature of plastic/ceramic circuit board [36] (Fig 5a,b).

Printing of spiral coils with rhomboidal turns avoids crowding at the inner radius of the armature [37] (Fig 5c). A 3D printed
version of a Halbach cylinder motor was based on a 3D printed structure in PLA which was tested at 5700 rpm but the magnets and
the coils were not 3D printed [21]. This would be particularly crucial for a Halbach motor because a Halbach array comprises
alternating main and transit permanent magnets arranged around the rotor. The magnetic configuration is crucial to the Halbach
motor operation - the magnetic field is concentrated by almost twice as much on one side of the array and reduced to near-zero on
the other. Similarly, a Halbach cylinder with high power-to-volume density concentrates its magnetic field toward its centre through
its arrangement of magnets to interact with its radial ferrite coils.
There are several approaches to 3D printing of bonded permanent magnets. Direct ink writing of elastomeric silicone rubber
composite with embedded ferromagnetic (NdFeB) microparticles and silica nanoparticles (for viscosity control) offers patterned
magnetic properties by applying magnetic fields ~2-3 T to the extrusion nozzle [25]. Such patterning could be exploited for 3D

morphological reconfigurability. Binder jetting has been employed to 3D print near-net-shape Nd2Fe14B permanent magnets [26].
The binder jetting process uses an inkjet nozzle to deposit a polymer binder over a bed of NdFeB powder (average around 70 μm
diameter) followed by application of a heat lamp to solidify the layer. Each 0.2 mm thick layer of magnetic powder and polymer is
successively added to form the green part which is then cured at 100-150oC for 4-6 h. The cured green part is then dip-coated with
low viscosity urethane resin to fully saturate the porous magnet (46% resin by volume) and reduce its brittleness. Alternatively,
infiltration by low melting point eutectic alloy (Nd3Cu0.25Co0.75 and Pr3Cu0.25Co0.75) improves densification by 46% and improves
the mechanical strength and intrinsic coercivity [27].

We present a fully 3D printed DC electric motor which utilised several 3D printing methods. It is important to note that we are
3D printing a DC electric motor from feedstock that is readily sourced on Earth – we discuss how this might inform the
construction of a lunar version in section IV. A basic DC electric motor comprises a fixed stator within which spins the rotor
controlled via a commutator assembly. Enamelled copper wire connects the commutator to the electrical power source; a
commutator/wire brush assembly cyclically reverses the supply current to the rotor; a stator mounts permanent magnets; a coiled
copper wire wound around a soft ferromagnetic core armature acts as an electromagnet. The interaction between the two magnet
fields generates a Lorenz torque on the rotor. The stationary brushes connect to the commutator switches and reverse the coil
current every half revolution through slip rings. In the brushless DC motor, the permanent magnets are in the rotor and the coils
around wound on stator. The use of ferrites over rare earth permanent magnets results in a larger motor for the same torque. Energy
losses in the soft magnetic material are due to: (i) hysteresis loss which can be reduced by low coercivity; (ii) eddy current loss
which can be reduced by low electrical conductivity; (iii) anomalous losses which can be reduced by using homogeneous material
to permit magnetic domain migration. It is essential that hysteresis in the electromagnet is minimised to ensure that no magnetic
field is retained on removal and reversal of the electric current. This requires soft magnetic materials for the magnetic core ferromagnetic material such soft iron or ferrites. Iron’s electrical conductivity makes it susceptible to eddy currents and heating

losses. To suppress eddy currents, the core may be constructed from thin insulated sheets forming a laminated core, e.g. sequences
of iron layers which are surface oxidised and sandwiched to limit eddy current transmission. Alternatively, micron-sized iron
powder may be embedded in an insulating matrix - this minimises eddy currents while magnetic field generation and magnetic
threading is maximised. Although eddy currents are a nuisance in electric motors, it is worth noting that they are exploited in
induction heating furnaces, non-contact braking, metal proximity sensors and metal crack detection. Induction heating involves
passing a current through a coil around the sample to be heated. The electric current frequency depends on the sample mass and is
generally more efficient than resistance heating. We adopted the DC electric motor as our 3D printed motor model because all other
motors are derived from it through reconfigurations of the same functional components. For example, synchronous AC motors
generate torque using either permanent magnets, magnetic reluctance or a combination (they are generally more efficient than AC
induction motors when operated at constant speed). A crucial aspect of motors is that, like all moving parts, they will be sensitive to
pervasive lunar dust – we do not address this specifically other than to suggest the existence of potential mitigation methods [62].
For most of our 3D printing, we used an Anet A8 3D printer based on the Prusa i3 with a 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.1-0.2 mm position
resolution. Our 3D CAD models were built using PTC Creo CAD software which was converted to STL format for slicing into
layers using Cura. We used a 15-18 V DC power supply for our 3D printed motors.

0.1 V and 0.01 A respectively and an AstroAI DM6000AR Multimeter (6000 counts) with voltage/current resolution of 5 mV at 30

two brushes of 20 Ga bare copper wire. For the wire-wound rotor, the commonest soft magnetic material is silicon steel (Fe-3% Si).
Typically, it reduces the incidence of eddy currents and is either laminated with insulation material such as polymer or silicon steel
particles are embedded with high loading in a polymer matrix. Binder jetting of magnetically soft silicon steel (Fe91Si9) yields
potentially higher magnetic permeability than powder metallurgy of soft magnetic composite powders [22]. Other possibilities
include new soft magnetic material with low coercivity/high electrical resistivity such as coarse particles of multicomponent alloy
(Fe32.6-Ni27.7-Co27.7-Ta5.0-Al7.0) dispersed within a ferromagnetic matrix [23] - a lunar version must omit Ta. Our first 3D printed
rotor cores were printed in Fe-3Si and Fe-6.5Si with 40 mm diameter by 14 mm length by NRC-Boucherville (Fig 9b and 9c
respectively). These comprised 50% Fe-Si particles in 50% PLA matrix by volume. We 3D printed motor cores of commercial offthe-shelf ProtoPastaTM (http://www.proto-pasta.com) magnetic PLA with the same geometry through extrusion (Fig 9a). The
ProtoPastaTM filament comprised 50% iron particles in 50% PLA by weight, i.e. considerably lighter than loading by volume.

The bonded Fe-6.5%Si steel impregnated PLA gave superior performance over the traditional bonded Fe-3%Si steel
impregnated PLA. However, the performance results clearly show that the ProtoPastaTM magnetic PLA rotor offers superior
performance in terms of RPM and torque output than the silicon steel rotors (Fig 11). We attribute this to the higher weight of the
Fe-Si particle impregnated rotors (136 g) compared to the ProtoPastaTM rotors (71 g). The increased inertia of the 50% steel particle
rotor by volume was not offset by the increased magnetically induced torque yielding a reduction in rotation speed performance
[24].

3.4 3D Printing Dual Excitation Motors

Reluctance motors have a rotating magnetic field around the stator concentrated at the poles (which are magnetically isolated
from each other) and drives the rotation of a soft magnetic rotor due to magnetic reluctance. We experimented with ProtoPastaTM to
3D print a variable reluctance motor (Fig 12) but we did not benchmark it. Our interest was to explore motors without permanent
magnets but we anticipated that the multi-coil design of the reluctance motor would present subsequent challenges for 3D printing.

Given the demonstrable success with ProtoPastaTM, we investigated the dual-excited DC motor using magnetic PLA material for
both rotor and stator magnets. Dual excitation motors eliminate permanent magnets by adopting separately-excited coils on
electromagnetic poles and the electromagnetic rotor but they still require brushes to transmit energy to the rotor. An open geometry
stator was insufficiently powerful to generate torque so a closed magnetic loop stator was printed with ProtoPastaTM (Fig 13a,b).
The rotor was wound with 70 turns/pole and the stator was wound with 100 turns/pole using an automatic wire winding system. An
automatic wire winding system was implemented using a Sherline 4410 mini-lathe (Fig 9c). The only non-3D printed parts were the
steel motor shafts and the copper coils. We also set up the 3D printed dual excitation motor with a 3D printed PLA step-down gear
to demonstrate closing of a hinged panel (as a proxy for self-deployment of structural panels [11]) (Fig 13c).

3.5 3D Printing Permanent Magnets for Stator

We explored the adoption of 3D printed permanent magnets for the DC motor stator. The cheapest permanent magnetic material
is ferrite in which dominant Fe2O3 particles are supplemented with Co additive (on the Moon, SrCO3 or BaCO3 that are the most
common additives would be unavailable) subjected to powder metallurgy. Our 3D printed electric motor used 3D printed highstrength rare earth element (30% Nd – 66.8% Fe – 1.0% B – 0.4% Al – 0.8% Nb – 1% Dy) permanent magnets manufactured ondemand by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Fig 10). There are several approaches to 3D printing of bonded permanent magnets.
Direct ink writing of elastomeric silicone rubber composite with embedded ferromagnetic (NdFeB) microparticles and silica
nanoparticles (for viscosity control) offers patterned magnetic properties by applying magnetic fields ~2-3 T to the extrusion nozzle
[25]. Such patterning could be exploited for 3D morphological reconfigurability. Binder jetting has been employed to 3D print
near-net-shape Nd2Fe14B permanent magnets [26]. The binder jetting process uses an inkjet nozzle to deposit a polymer binder over
a bed of NdFeB powder (average around 70 μm diameter) followed by application of a heat lamp to solidify the layer. Each 0.2 mm
thick layer of magnetic powder and polymer is successively added to form the green part which is then cured at 100-150oC for 4-6
h. The cured green part is then dip-coated with low viscosity urethane resin to fully saturate the porous magnet (46% resin by
volume) and reduce its brittleness. Alternatively, infiltration by low melting point eutectic alloy (Nd3Cu0.25Co0.75 and
Pr3Cu0.25Co0.75) improves densification with 46% eutectic alloy, mechanical strength and intrinsic coercivity [27]. Oak Ridge
National Laboratories’ Big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) facility uses melt extrusion of thermoplastic composite mounted
onto a gantry system for unbounded size [28]. Extrusion from pellets of 65% NdFeB plate-shaped powder of 20-200 μm diameter
with 35% nylon-12 binder by volume at 285oC (lower than the NdFeB Curie temperature of 360oC) onto a heated aluminium bed at
95oC) increased the magnetic density and eliminated the porosity impregnation step. The 3D printed NdFeB permanent magnets
from using BAAM outperform conventional injection-moulded magnets with a remanence of 0.51 T and ultimate tensile strength of
6.60 MPa. High magnetic alignment of NdFeB particles in a polymer binder is enhanced by an applied magnetic field on the binder
during its transition from high elasticity to lower viscosity at <100oC [29]. BAAM was used to extrude a high NdFeB loading
fraction of 70% in 30% nylon binder into 3D printed permanent magnets with superior properties (ultimate tensile strength of 12.6
MPa and remanence of 0.58 T) which was demonstrated in a 12 V dc electric motor assembly (not 3D printed) [30]. A silica
ceramic coating provided thermal stability to oxidation at high temperature. Our permanent magnets were similarly 3D printed by
Oak Ridge using the same BAAM technology (Fig 14a). These were used in several motor configurations including the fully 3D
printed DC motor (Fig 14b).

Magnetisation of a permanent magnet involves applying an external magnetic field to saturation which is then slightly
demagnetised for stabilisation. The external field is generated by a capacitor bank to yield a very short current pulse through a coil.
After printing, our rare earth magnets were exposed to a short current pulse to generate an applied magnetic field 4-5 times its
coercive force through a magnetising coil (Table 2):

The wiring and wire coils were the most challenging to address with 3D printing technologies. To investigate 3D printing of
coils, we used a pancake (axial flux) motor configuration [31] (Fig 15).

are well established [35]. Photolithographically-printed copper wiring on the epoxy-glass laminate stator is parallel to the rotor
which carries alternating currents to generate rotor spin. Alternatively, the flat current winding is etched onto a flat armature of
plastic/ceramic circuit board [36] (Fig 12a,b).

Printing of spiral coils with rhomboidal turns avoids crowding at the inner radius of the armature [37]. This is more difficult to
manufacture, We initially etched double-sided copper-clad PCBs with a simpler geometry of octagonal spiralling coils (Fig 16). A
600 dpi laser printer was used to print the coil schematic onto transparent film 416-T mask. Photoresist MG 416-X was used to treat
the PCB and then exposed to UV light through the mask. The board was immersed into MG Chemical developer solution which
removed the UV-exposed resist. The exposed copper was removed by immersion in MG 415 etchant leaving the armature winding
pattern.

The number of spirals per layer equates to the number of rotor poles P. Each octagon winding comprised nine turns with traces
and spacing of 1 mm giving 18 turns/pole. A single double-sided and two double-sided PCBs were separated by 3D printed
polymer spacing. They were mounted into a stator with embedded off-the-shelf permanent magnets yielding an increase in
performance from 500 rpm to 700 rpm. We anticipated that this photolithographic approach would be difficult to adapt to a
traditional DC motor configuration with orthogonal wiring.

Our next approach was to 3D print a pancake rotor using two filaments deployed from a single printer head. The substrate was
printed using ProtoPastaTM and cooled followed by deposition of Electrifi conductive copper filament with a resistivity of 0.006
Ω.cm. The copper filament comprised copper-impregnated PLA plastic to print conductive tracks (Fig 17). Printing the copperimpregnated filament required reducing the print speed to 15 mm/s and maintaining a minimum 0.2 mm gap between the nozzle
and the printing surface. A more efficient spiral coil geometry was printed because the rotor coils lie parallel to the rotor disk.

Such materials are suited to electrical conduction of data at low voltages/currents but power electronics impose high
voltages/currents. On connecting up to a DC power supply to test its conductivity, an applied voltage of 3.4 V generated hot spots
on contact due to increased resistance of 17 Ω with 200 mA currents. Such conductive filament is unsuited to electrical power
applications such as motors. Our motor runs at 12 V which would melt the polymer matrix. This limitation applies to all current
conductive polymers as well as they are developed for low-voltage data electronics. The wires and wire coils of motors cannot be
polymer-based due to poor current-carrying capacity requiring instead conductive metals. There is the further problem of thermally
sintering of copper-impregnated pastes without melting the substrate. One approach would be to create microchannels of silicone
which is tolerant of significant temperatures up to ~300oC. 3D printing of microfluidic systems requires submillimetre scale
manufacture of silicone for the enclosing channels [38]. Silicone moulds and templates may be 3D printed using SLA in the shape
of microchannels with sub-100 nm features. The microchannels may then be filled with room temperature liquid metals such as
mercury or gallium. However, we considered this approach to be too complex (and there are no near room temperature liquid
metals available on the Moon). An alternative approach is to print metal directly onto a substrate: for high precision, fine channels
may be etched to guide the metal tracks with subsequent milling. Metal conductive tracks are commonly 3D printed using
nanoparticle conductive inks. Laser annealing is necessary to create fully metallic conductive tracks on a substrate. This has been
the approach for 3D printing of electronic devices including conductive wiring such as conductive strips on conformal antennas.
The difficulty with these approaches is lifting such conductive tracks to wrap them around a DC motor in the transverse direction to
rotor printing.

Metal conductors were required so we adopted a variant on laminated object manufacture (LOM) for the wire and wire coils of
the motor (Fig 18). A layer of metal foil with thin adhesive backing acting as an insulating layer (in this case, copper but could be
substituted with aluminium foil on the Moon) was applied to a worktop and rolled flat. A Cricut Explore Air 2 cutting machine was
programmed with the wire coil design to cut a 0.0762 mm layer of copper sheet into the desired shape (Fig 18a). The excess copper
was removed by hand leaving only the desired shaped 2D layer. The four-quadrant design minimises the number of soldering points
to four compared with a traditional radial pattern of pancake motors which require not far short of 100 solder points depending on
the size of the rotor cross section. The copper winding trace was taped onto both sides of the 3D printed pancake rotor of magnetic
PLA and mounted into a stator assembly with embedded permanent magnets for testing (Fig 18b,c). Its performance was similar to
the PCB motor with photolithographically-printed copper as expected.

A mounted Hall effect sensor measured the back EMF from the rotor spin to permit the control electronics synchronise pulsing
of the coils (neither the permanent magnets nor the Hall sensor were 3D printed). In LOM, further adhesive layers are added and
heated with the hot roller to bond the layers together to build up the 3D part. In our case, we required only a single layer of foil to
form the conducting ribbons while retaining their thin adhesive layer. This approach is consistent with 3D fabrication of electronic
components such as resistors, capacitors and inductors with multiple layers of conductive strips.
3.7 Assembly of Fully 3D Printed DC Motor

We returned to the fully 3D printed DC electric motor configuration to combine all the earlier elements. The basic structural
components (bracket), motor shaft, bearings and bolts were 3D printed using PLA (Fig 19a). The stator structure that holds the Oak
Ridge-printed permanent magnets and the rotor were printed using ProtoPastaTM magnetic PLA (Fig 19a). Four 3D printed NdFeB
bonded permanent magnets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory were embedded into the stator. Once again, the chief problem was
the copper coils. If the ribbons were too thin, they could not be manually wound around the rotor without breaking. Hence, we
printed wider ribbons of 5 mm width which were more durable enabling them to be wrapped around the rotor with 17 turns/pole
after coating with silicone conformal coating for durable insulation (Fig 19b).

inferior to any commercial motor of similar size due to the minimal number of wiring turns [39] (Fig 21). The RPM plateaued at a

This was a proof-of-concept of a 3D printed motor but too inferior for practical utility. The few-turn wire coils were the culprit
for the poor performance as shown below in subsequent experiments. Although fully 3D printed, it required three different 3D
printing techniques and required sophisticated assembled by hand. There have been attempts to minimise assembly operations for
electrical machines. A functional soft magnetic core solenoid of stacked plates was printed from a single multi-material FDM
printer extruding filaments and pellets [53]. Each plate comprised alternating spiral conductors from a central soft iron core
separated by insulating plates. The conductive spiral was formed by introducing conductive connections through the insulator
between the stacked plates. Three materials were printed – pure PLA for insulating structures, PLA impregnated with copper
particles for electrical conductors and PLA or nylon impregnated with Fe or FeSiAl particles respectively for soft magnetic cores.
The advantage of this approach is that it exploits a single 3D printer to minimise assembly but the copper-impregnated conductive
elements were limited to 60 mA so the maximum field generable was ~1 G which is very low. The current tradeoff is between
motor performance which requires the adoption of different 3D printing methods for different materials against the complexity of
assembly. One can envisage adopting a single FDM approach in which Protopasta was adopted for magnetic elements and copperimpregnated PLA for conductive elements of an entirely polymer-based motor but such a motor would have such a poor
performance that it is questionable whether it could function at all.

It was not possible to make direct comparison of our fully 3D-printed DC motor with a comparable commercial motor even if
one could be sourced with a similar geometry as there would be too many variables to perform meaningful analysis. Indeed, we
alluded to the small number of coil turns around the rotor – this presents a major limitation in the fully 3D printed motor. One way
this could be circumvented is to supplement 3D printing with wire drawing through a series of dies. The wire may be copper, or in
the case of the Moon, aluminium. Indeed, aluminium wiring is common in motors, generators and transformers. Insulation may be
implemented coating with fused silica powder and cured thermally (enamelling), wrapping with fiberglass or silicone polymer tape
or extrusion of silicone polymer or fused silica powder around the wire as it is drawn. Wire drawing is similar to extrusion except
that it involves pulling rather than pushing through an orifice. It is not inconceivable that an extrusion nozzle of a 3D printer may be
adapted to wire drawing. To compromise, we benchmarked a partially 3D printed motor (eliminating the problem of matching
copper coils) against an off-the-shelf Dynamite DYN 1171 brushed permanent magnet DC motor which was disassembled to
extract its physical parameters (Fig 22).

This off-the-shelf motor was used to 3D print versions from ProtoPastaTM magnetic PLA that were as similar as possible (Fig

the commercial stator magnets which showed enhanced RPM output with the 3D printed rotor over the commercial product. It is
important to note that we were proving a concept – that 3D printed motors can be constructed rather than optimising their
performance against a commercial grade production motor.

Our approach to 3D printing the DC motor relied on multiple 3D printing approaches followed by manual assembly of the
motor. For DC electric motors on the Moon where copper is scarce, conductive wiring of aluminium with enamel (glass) insulation
would be adopted [54]. For operation on the Moon where temperatures can approach ~120oC, the temperature tolerance of
hydrocarbon plastic such as PLA binder is poor so it will have to be replaced with silicone plastic or ceramic insulation which
introduces a suite of challenges for 3D printing. The next stage would be to merge: (i) 3D printing technologies of different
materials into a single 3D printing mechanism; (ii) incorporate non-3D printing processing technologies where appropriate such as
wire extrusion/drawing; (iii) eliminate manual assembly with integrated manufacture and automated self-assembly. 3D printing of
multimaterial parts represents a considerable challenge in integrating 3D printing into a more general fabrication process. Different
3D printing methods are appropriate to different engineering materials. In general, polymers such as ABS, PEEK, etc. are printed
through fused deposition modelling (except for photosensitive resins which are printed using ultraviolet stereolithography). Metals
such as steels, titanium alloys, aluminium alloys, etc. may be printed using selective laser sintering/melting and electron beam
additive manufacturing (the latter is restricted to metals only). Ceramics are typically processed as particles within a matrix material
but they present challenges for 3D printing [55]. There are several strategies that might be employed to implement multimaterial
fabrication using different 3D printing methods [40]. In extrusion and direct ink writing, different materials may be pre-mixed into
a blend for extrusion. Stereolithography may implement multiple vats of different photopolymers on a carousel. Direct energy
deposition may similarly use pre-mixed powders which can implement functionally graded materials from a single nozzle by
gradually modifying processing parameters. Additive manufacturing of metals offers the possibility of graded metal composition
within single parts. Metal alloy chemical composition may be tuned through laser printing into graded physical properties such as
magnetism [41]. Such methods may be adopted to 3D print integrated and blended magnetic areas within a load-bearing structure
designed with other favourable properties such as vibration suppression. These approaches to multimaterial 3D printing are limited
to variations on the same type of material – polymer-polymer, metal-metal and polymer-composite. Composites with metal or
ceramic particles embedded within a plastic matrix are a variation on multimaterial 3D printing. Hybrid 3D printing combines
multiple 3D printing techniques to 3D print different materials. The chief problem with multi-material parts is that there are sharp
material interfaces – typically an adhesive bond - between different materials which can exhibit high stress concentrations. One
approach is to introduce arrays of small interlocking joints such as dovetails or similar. Further challenges for metal-ceramic and
metal-plastic occur due to their different thermo-mechanical properties, especially differing melting points. We have been
developing a method for 3D printing molten aluminium onto silicone plastic substrates to demonstrate simultaneous use of metal
and plastic in a 3D printing context (Fig 26a).

We are currently developing an in-house custom multi-material 3D printer that will combine silicone extrusion and aluminium
powder bed fusion with a milling head integrated into a single unit (Fig 26b). Some non-3D printing processes may be integrated
into 3D printing such as subtractive machining by integrating a two- or four-axis CNC milling tool (z degree of freedom is provided
by the work platform) for surface finishing of rough 3D printed parts. This introduces a potential problem of jigs if the part is not
bonded to the work platform. Other non-3D printing processes may be more challenging to integrate but are nonetheless necessary
such as hot isostatic pressing to relieve internal stresses generated by lamination. Clearly, there are significant challenges to 3D
printing multiple components comprising multiple materials – this is the holy grail of 3D printing.

We have demonstrated that a functional DC electric motor may be 3D printed but there are several challenging tasks that must
be solved to robustify and automate the process. This step is crucial. To round out the electric motor into a full motor system, we
must incorporate integrated sensors and computational electronics. Although conductive and semiconductor polymers offer
potential, their deployment for power distribution is debatable. Nevertheless, 3D printing all mechatronic components including
suites of sensors and active electronics opens up the possibility of 3D printing robots and other kinematic machines on the
assumption that the structural aspect can be 3D printed trivially. If so, other kinematic machines may be 3D printed including
different types of 3D printers, milling machines, lathes, drills, etc. These are the machines of production. This would constitute a
universal construction capability in building generic machines of production. By definition, universal construction implies that selfreplicating machines are implicitly realisable. This could include energy systems (that were excluded from von Neumann’s original
analysis) – for energy storage, we can build motor-driven flywheels and for solar generation, we can construct solar concentrators
and solar-electric converters [42]. The implementation of self-replicating machines on the Moon offers a low-cost route to massive
lunar industrialisation and beyond. But the first step is to demonstrate 3D printing of mechatronic components including electric
motors. To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin: “For want of a 3D printed motor, lunar industrialisation was lost….”. Perhaps not.

Reviewer #1:

Reviewers' comments:
GENERAL RESPONSE: All changes have been shown in red.

GENERAL RESPONSE: I thank the reviewer for their time and effort. The reviewer did not
appear to notice that a 3D printed motor was achieved and seemed to focus on a few lines
about pancake rotors. We have in fact 3D printed a DC electric motor in its entirety (Fig 20).
With the new structure of sub-sections in section III, this should be clearer.

ev

REVIEWER 1: The authors cite appropriate literature. What is not clear is the novelty of the
current article given that others have published printable motor designed before, as
acknowledged by the authors.

er
r

RESPONSE: Previous “printable” motors were not fully “printed” as stated at several points in
the text. I made a very clear statement in line 1 page 6 that was in the original document:
“Structural aspects of the stator and rotor of an axial flux motor have been 3D printed before
[34] and printed pancake motor rotors are well established [35].” Ref [34] employs 3D printing
for passive structure only. In ref [35], “printing” is photolithographic printing, not 3D printing.
Furthermore, this “printing” refers only to rotors of pancake motors. Our 3D printed pancake
rotor is shown in Fig 19 and 20. Our final electric motor was a DC electric motor which was fully
3D-printed using a range of 3D printing methods (Figs 14, 19 and 20).

pe

REVIEWER 1: From the title of the paper, it seemed that the authors would be printing motors
from feed stock. But it turns out that this is not the case.

tn

ot

RESPONSE: All 3D printers print from feedstock – by definition, the input material to a 3D
printer (or any other manufacturing machine) is feedstock. If you are referring to lunar regolith
as feedstock, the title of the paper makes no such claim (there is no reference to the Moon in
the title). Nevertheless, we have referred to other published papers that address this issue of
converting lunar regolith into useful feedstocks such as aluminium metal which is a
multifunctional metal – line before Table 1 (page 2): “we have demonstrated in the laboratory,
the extraction of aluminium metal from lunar highland regolith simulant rich in anorthite [44,45].”
This activity is published elsewhere. If we made a fully 3D printed DC motor from lunar regolith,
we would have to solve the holy grail of 3D printing of dealing with multimaterials – as discussed
in Section IV. To make clear the scope of the article, the second sentence of section 3.1 is
explicit.

rin

REVIEWER 1: The first set of motors presented have stator cores that are printed, but then wire
is coiled around them. The means for producing such wires and coating them in the lunar
setting was not explained.

Pr

ep

RESPONSE: We described a developmental process beginning with rotors, then stators, then
coils culminating in our 3D printed DC motor. The first set of motors were rotor cores which
were wound with wire (Fig 9 and 10). We then progressed to magnetically soft stators (Fig 13).
Regarding wiring, second sentence of section IV states: “For DC electric motors on the Moon
where copper is scarce, conductive wiring of aluminium or nickel with enamel (glass) insulation
would be adopted [54].” However, I have added a short segment in section 3.8 that discusses
manufacture of wiring and their insulation (we have in fact drawn series 1000 aluminium wire

that was extracted from lunar regolith simulant but that was not as coils but as feedstock for
electron beam additive manufacturing – to be published elsewhere).

REVIEWER 1: In the pancake motors that others have published on over the past decades,
which were acknowledged and adopted here, it is clear that the rotor can be printed but how are
the high-field-strength rare earth magnets to be printed?

ev

RESPONSE: Previous pancake rotors were “printed” photolithographically – we 3D printed them
using LOM (Fig 18). Note, our final 3D printed motor was a DC motor (Fig 20). An entire section
- section 3.5 – which was in the original document described in detail the 3D printing of rare
earth magnets at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that we used (some of that literature review
material has been moved to the end of section II).
REVIEWER 1: In short, the title over-hypes what is actually being done here.

er
r

RESPONSE: The reviewer has not recognised that a fully 3D printed DC motor has been
constructed and operated – it is shown in Figs 14, 19 and 20 – its performance in now included
in Fig 21. A video of it operating was included. The title begins “3D Printed Motors….” which is
exactly as described in the text.

pe

REVIEWER 1: As mentioned above, this could be a nice review, framing the general problem
and citing what had come before, and pointing to the future with the authors new (yet
preliminary) results. But as a research journal paper it seems to be lacking in completeness and
novelty, despite the far-out (and potentially important) application domain.

ot

RESPONSE: The major content of the paper describes our process in building a fully 3D printed
electric motor – that would not be suitable for a review paper. Nobody, to our knowledge, has
built a fully 3D printed electric motor. It is complete – rotor, stator, permanent magnets, coils,
brushes, shaft, bearings. By definition, if something hasn’t been built before, then it is novel.

tn

REVIEWER 1: In the lunar setting it is not clear that elastomeric actuators would make sense
since the polymeric chains may easily break down due to radiation damage from the solar wind,
etc.

rin

RESPONSE: I cannot find where I made such a suggestion – however, I have now critiqued
smart material-based actuators in section II. Hydrocarbon polymers are sensitive to radiation but
silicone elastomers are not because their backbones are strong O-Si-O chains rather than C-CC chains.
REVIEWER 1: Moreover, regolith has a tendency to electrostatically cling to everything. So
motors would need to be designed to be fully enclosed to keep clean. The authors don't seem to
be concerned with these issues, which are significant.

ep

RESPONSE: There is an entire industry concerned with lunar dust mitigation – it was not our
focus as it is peripheral. However, I have added a short statement and reference to work we
have done on precisely this problem [62] in the third last sentence of section 3.1.

Pr

REVIEWER 1: It is crucial that the authors follow one of two paths: 1) Modify the manuscript to
turn this into a review paper and point towards open issues to open up the topic to a broader
community; or 2) Really print a full motor including coils, magnets, bearing structures, etc.,

ed

rather than only selected components, and demonstrate its functionality. Option 2 seems quite
hard, but would keep the manuscript honest to the title.
RESPONSE: We have already really printed a full motor (option 2) and demonstrated its
functionality – magnets, bearing structures, rotor, coils, etc were all 3D printed using different
3D printing techniques – imaged in Fig 20, performance in Fig 21 and videoed in action.

ev

REVIEWER 1: To have even broader impact when pursuing option 1, perhaps the authors
should collaborate with some subset of the authors of the prior works that they cite, and on
which the current work is based. That would broaden the readership of a review paper if they
decide to go that way. Alternatively, they can go back to the lab and really print a full a motor
from feed stock to live up to the title and keep this as an original research paper rather than a
review.

er
r

RESPONSE: We have achieved option 2 which is a fully 3D printed motor from feedstock
pictured in Fig 20 with a video of it running and its performance in Fig 21.

Reviewer #2:

pe

In this study, the author addresses 3D printing mechatronic triad components for robotics and
presents the design process for fabricating a DC electric motor through 3D printing. The
reviewer believes that the manuscript requires substantial revisions. The following points should
be addressed to improve the clarity and organization of the paper:
GENERAL RESPONSE: I thank the reviewer for their constructive comments – their
suggestions have enhanced the paper considerably.

tn

ot

REVIIEWER 2: 1. The figures need to be reorganized to enhance their relevance to the
discussion. Several figures lack sufficient explanation or are not referenced in the text, such as
Figure 4, while Figures 2 and 5 are not discussed. Additionally, Figure 12 has missing/hard to
see labels. The label "TEST RESULTS GRAPH" should also be removed from Figure 21.
Overall, the figures need to be more organized.

rin

RESPONSE: Understood – I have been through each figure and made sure that they are
referred to in the text with explanatory text. In particular, I have added explanatory text to Fig 2
and referenced the components of Fig 5 (now Fig 9) in the text. I have enlarged some figures to
render labels more legible….. Figure 12 (now Fig 5) had no labels. I cannot remove the label
from Fig 21 (now Fig 25) as it embedded in the figure…..

ep

REVIEWER 2: 2. It would be great if the authors organized the text to have sections to better
guide readers on the approach and results.
RESPONSE: Very good idea – I have added subsections in Section III which has made it a lot
easier to navigate.

Pr

REVIEWER 2: 3. The link mentioned on page 7, line 4, should be properly cited in accordance
with the journal's citation format.
RESPONSE: Page 9 – this is a citation to a company rather than a publication.

RESPONSE: They have been added in the paragraph after Fig 10.

ed

REVIEWER 2: 4. The author attributes the poorer performance of the Fe-Si rotor to its heavier
weight compared to the ProtoPasta rotor. However, the exact weights of each rotor are not
provided. What are the specific weight values for each design?

REVIEWER 2: Additionally, how would the performance comparison change if the total core
weight were standardized, for example, by adjusting the infill density? The relationship between
rotor weight and performance needs further clarification.

ev

RESPONSE: We bookended the two designs – off-the-shelf ProtoPasta (50:50 by mass) and
NRC provided us with 50:50 by volume. We chose to not to find if there was an optimal
intermediate condition for reasons of expense of many pucks from NRC. We could have
standardised rotor mass and played around with different ratios but this would have increased
costs with little to gain (at this stage). This might be useful for future work but here we were
proving the 3D printed motor concept rather than detailed design which could come later.

er
r

REVIEWER 2: 5. The author should present detailed specifications for the design variables and
3D printing conditions to provide a clearer understanding of how these factors influence
performance.

pe

RESPONSE: We did not vary the design variables much as we were more concerned with
benchmarking against a commercial motor. We followed the recommended parameters for
printing ProtoPasta. The Oak Ridge and NRC printing data is not available for IP reasons.
Nevertheless, our benchmarking experiments clearly demonstrate the importance of wire coils
on performance.

ot

REVIEWER 2: 6. The structure of the manuscript is currently unclear, with the literature review
interspersed with the results. It is recommended that the relevant literature be moved to the
introduction to provide a more cohesive background, and that the results be grouped into a
dedicated section with appropriate subsections for clarity.

tn

RESPONSE: Thank you for suggesting this – it has been done – everything associated with
literature review has been collected (and expanded) at the latter part of section II.

rin

REVIEWER 2: 7. While Figure 7 presents RPM and torque measurements for the three designs,
there is no mention of data repeatability. Has the author conducted multiple trials for each
design to assess measurement consistency? If so, what are the observed variations?

ep

RESPONSE: We did run several experiments on each and obtained consistent results – we did
not analyse variations between experiments systematically as the observed consistency did not
seem to require it at this stage. We presented one set of results as representative. There was
little point in running statistically-significant numbers of experiments at this stage.

Pr

REVIEWER 2: 8. In addition to RPM and torque, the author should consider evaluating other
key performance metrics such as energy efficiency and the lifetime of each motor design.
Furthermore, have there been any observations of temperature changes during operation? Has
the author investigated the duration the 3D-printed motors can run before exhibiting signs of
failure?
RESPONSE: We did not consider energy efficiency given that we were prototyping rather than
design optimising. Although we did not measure temperature, we were however conscious of

the temperature limitations of PLA (as with most polymers) to maintain under 120oC. In all our
experiments, there was no melting (except using copper-impregnated PLA for coils on the
pancake motor which we subsequently discarded as an option). We did not conduct lifetime
assessments as we did not have the resources to do so. There seemed little point as we are still
in the prototyping stage.
REVIEWER 2: 9. The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed description of the
experimental setup. Specifically, the author should provide information on how the RPM and
torque were measured and the resolution of the measurement tools used.
