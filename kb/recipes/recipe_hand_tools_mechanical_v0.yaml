assumptions: "Comprehensive mechanical hand tool set for assembly, maintenance, and repair. 15 kg set includes wrenches (open-end, box-end, adjustable), socket set with ratchet, screwdrivers (flat and Phillips), pliers (slip-joint, needle-nose, locking), hammers (ball-peen, claw), Allen key set, punches, and files. Hardened steel construction. Essential for all mechanical work."
notes: "Manufacturing of mechanical hand tool set. Total fabrication time ~34 hours. Multi-component production includes forging, precision machining, heat treatment for hardness (HRC 45-55 for working surfaces), surface finishing, and assembly. Critical for general workshop capability."
