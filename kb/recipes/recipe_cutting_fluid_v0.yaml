    notes: "Import cutting fluid concentrate; local dilution and maintenance handled in use."
assumptions: Cutting fluid concentrates are imported initially; local regeneration (filtration/treatment) can extend service life once in use.
notes: Cutting fluid extends tool life, improves surface finish, and removes chips during machining. Water-based emulsions or oil-based fluids; import baseline until additive chemistry is modeled.
