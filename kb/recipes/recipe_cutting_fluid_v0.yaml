assumptions: Water-based cutting fluid formulated from emulsifying oils and additives. Oil-based fluids can be formulated from mineral or synthetic oils with EP additives. Initial batches may use imported concentrates diluted with local water.
notes: Cutting fluid extends tool life, improves surface finish, and removes chips during machining. Can be water-based (emulsions) or oil-based. Must be maintained with proper filtration and biocide treatment.
