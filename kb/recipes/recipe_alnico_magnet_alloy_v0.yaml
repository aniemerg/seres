kind: recipe
target_item_id: alnico_magnet_alloy_v0
variant_id: v0
steps:
  - process_id: alnico_alloy_synthesis_v0
assumptions: |
  AlNiCo magnet alloy produced from primary metals (Al, Ni, Co, Fe).
  Composition: Al 8-12%, Ni 14-28%, Co 24-40%, Fe balance.
notes: |
  Primary production route for AlNiCo magnet alloy from raw metals.
  Breaks circular dependency with alnico_casting_block_v0.
  Previous remelting-only approach created chicken-and-egg problem.
