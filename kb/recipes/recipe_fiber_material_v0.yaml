    notes: "Draw molten material through spinneret to form continuous fibers"
assumptions: "Basalt or glass fiber production for lunar textile manufacturing. Molten material drawn through fine orifices to create continuous fibers. Alternative to organic fibers using lunar-available materials."
notes: "Production of inorganic fiber material from basalt or glass. Suitable for high-temperature applications, filtration, and structural textiles. Processing time ~5 hours per kg fiber."
