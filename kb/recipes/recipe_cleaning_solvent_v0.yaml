notes: |
  Placeholder recipe for cleaning solvent or detergent.

  Cleaning solvents and detergents require:
  - Surfactant synthesis (complex organic chemistry)
  - Solvent production (petroleum distillation or fermentation)
  - Formulation and blending

  Marked as import due to chemical synthesis complexity.
