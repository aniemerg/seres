    notes: "Precision touch probe imported from Earth due to high-precision mechanical and electrical requirements"
assumptions: Touch probes require precision mechanical components, ruby or ceramic probe tips, sensitive electrical contact detection, and calibration. Import until precision manufacturing and metrology infrastructure is established.
notes: High-precision measurement probe for CMM systems. Achieves sub-micron repeatability for dimensional verification. Critical for quality control and reverse engineering applications.
