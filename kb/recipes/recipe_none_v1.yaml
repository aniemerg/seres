    notes: "Placeholder material 'none' represents null/zero input for waste generation processes"
assumptions: |
  'none' is a conceptual placeholder for processes that generate waste/byproducts.
  Not a real material - represents zero or negligible input.
notes: |
  Recipe for placeholder material 'none'.
  Used in waste generation processes to indicate byproducts created as side effects.
  Changed from pass_through_none_v0 to environment_source_v0 to break circular dependency.
