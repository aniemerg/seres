    notes: "Calibrate tension feedback and brake response"
assumptions: Mechanical tension control with electronic feedback. Brake mechanism provides variable resistance to maintain constant tension.
notes: Tension control system for wire and fiber winding operations. Maintains consistent tension during spooling.
