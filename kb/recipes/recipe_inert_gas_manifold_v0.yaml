    notes: "Pressure test all connections for leak-tight operation"
assumptions: Machined manifold block with installed valves and fittings. Welded pipe connections. Leak tested for controlled atmosphere applications. Mass ~20 kg.
notes: Gas manifold and valving system for controlled atmosphere chambers. Distributes inert gas (argon, nitrogen) with pressure control.
