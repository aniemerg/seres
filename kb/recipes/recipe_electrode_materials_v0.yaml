steps:
  - process_id: electrode_fabrication_nife
    notes: Mix and press Ni-Fe electrode materials with collectors.
  - process_id: cathode_oxide_coating_v0
    notes: Apply oxide coating as required.
assumptions: "Aggregated electrode material preparation for Ni-Fe cells; refine with specific anode/cathode splits later."
notes: Local route supplying electrode_materials instead of import placeholder.
