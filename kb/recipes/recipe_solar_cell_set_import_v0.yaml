  Import recipe for solar cell set.

  Solar cell manufacturing requires:
  - High-purity polysilicon (9N+ purity)
  - Czochralski or float-zone crystal growth
  - Wafer slicing and polishing
  - Cleanroom diffusion doping
  - PECVD anti-reflective coating
  - Screen-printed metallization
  - Testing and binning

  This level of semiconductor manufacturing is beyond early ISRU capability.
  Marked as import until advanced semiconductor fab is available.
