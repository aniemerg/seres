    notes: Melt tin and lead together, mix to eutectic composition, cast into bars or extrude into wire
assumptions: |
  Eutectic 63/37 Sn/Pb composition for lowest melting point (183°C).
  Can be cast into bars or extruded into wire for different applications.
  Standard solder formulation for electronics and general purpose soldering.
notes: |
  Manufacturing route for tin-lead solder.
  Used in wave soldering, hand soldering, and general joining applications.
  May need flux separately for some applications.
