    notes: Hot forge blanks into spherical shape
  - process_id: heat_treatment_hardening_v0
    est_time_hr: 2.0
    machine_hours: 2.0
    notes: Harden grinding balls to HRC 58-65 for wear resistance
  - process_id: tumbling_deburring_v0
    est_time_hr: 1.5
    machine_hours: 1.5
    notes: Tumble to remove scale and improve sphericity

assumptions: "Steel grinding balls for ball mills and grinding operations. Hardened for wear resistance and impact toughness."
notes: "Four-step process for manufacturing steel grinding media including forging, heat treatment, and finishing. Typical sizes 25-50mm diameter."
