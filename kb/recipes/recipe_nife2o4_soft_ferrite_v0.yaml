produces_id: nife2o4_soft_ferrite_v0
produces_qty: 1.0
produces_unit: kg
target_item_id: nife2o4_soft_ferrite_v0
variant_id: v0
steps:
- process_id: ferrite_powder_synthesis_ni_v0
assumptions: "Seed recipe linking Ni ferrite powder production to ferrite powder synthesis; placeholder values."
notes: |-
  This is a seed recipe for NiFe2O4 powder production. The precursor (ferrite_powder_precursor_ni_v0)
  is consumed by ferrite_powder_synthesis_ni_v0 to yield Ni ferrite powder. Details of the chemistry can be refined later.
