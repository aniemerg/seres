    notes: "Test hammer operation, impact force, and safety systems"
assumptions: Heavy forging equipment for hot metal forming. Requires massive frame and components for repeated impact loading. Critical for producing forged components with enhanced mechanical properties.
notes: Power hammer provides repeated impact for hot forging operations. Essential for making tools, machine components, and structural parts with superior grain structure and strength compared to cast parts.
