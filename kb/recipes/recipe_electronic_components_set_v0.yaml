    notes: "Electronic components imported from Earth due to semiconductor fabrication complexity"
assumptions: Semiconductor device fabrication requires cleanrooms, photolithography, chemical vapor deposition, ion implantation, and advanced metrology beyond early bootstrapping capability. Components imported until electronics manufacturing infrastructure is established.
notes: Basic discrete electronic components for circuit assembly. Passive components (resistors, capacitors) may be manufacturable earlier than active semiconductors (transistors, ICs).
