    notes: "Form green compact from ceramic powder mixture (pressing, molding, or slip casting)"
assumptions: "Unfired ('green') ceramic part formed from ceramic powder with binders. Ready for sintering to achieve final strength. Fragile and requires careful handling. Water loss during drying ~4%."
notes: "Manufacturing of green ceramic part. Total processing time ~6.3 hours. Must be sintered to achieve final ceramic properties."
