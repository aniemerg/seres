    notes: Test watchdog timing and reset functionality
assumptions: Watchdog timer implemented with discrete components (oscillator, counter ICs, reset circuit). Can use vacuum tube or solid-state components depending on availability.
notes: Manufacturing route for hardware watchdog timer. Used for system fault detection and automatic reset.
