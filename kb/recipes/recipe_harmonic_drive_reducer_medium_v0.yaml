  Import recipe for harmonic drive gear reducer.

  Harmonic drives require:
  - High-precision gear tooth machining (micron tolerances)
  - Thin-walled flexspline fabrication
  - Heat treatment for hardness and dimensional stability
  - Advanced metrology for tooth accuracy verification

  Initially imported. Lunar manufacturing possible with precision grinding
  and heat treatment capability.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.2.2.
