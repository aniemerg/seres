    notes: Placeholder for firmware compilation/distribution; assumes toolchain available off-graph.
assumptions: "Firmware binaries are imported or built off-line; future work can add toolchain build steps."
notes: "Creates explicit supply path for firmware binaries so programming processes have upstream availability."
