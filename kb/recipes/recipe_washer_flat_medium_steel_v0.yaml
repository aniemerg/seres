    notes: "Punch washers from steel sheet using progressive die. Outer diameter, inner hole, and edge chamfer in single or multi-stage operation."

assumptions: |
  Generic flat washer production for M6-M12 sizes. Process covers 2x size range.
  Starting material: steel sheet 1-3mm thick (material_class: steel).
  Progressive die stamping enables high-volume production with minimal scrap.
  Scrap skeleton can be recycled for next batch.

notes: |
  Simple stamping operation for flat washers. Progressive or compound dies can produce
  finished washers at high rates (hundreds per minute). Sheet thickness selected based on
  washer size: M6-M8 uses ~1.5mm, M10-M12 uses ~2.5mm sheet.
