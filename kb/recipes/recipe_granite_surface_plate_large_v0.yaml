target_item_id: granite_surface_plate_large
variant_id: lapped_granite_v0
steps:
  - process_id: cutting_basic_v0
    notes: Cut granite block to plate dimensions (placeholder using generic cutting).
  - process_id: surface_finishing_v0
    notes: Grind/lap surface to flatness; stand-in for precision lapping.
  - process_id: inspection_basic_v0
    notes: Flatness inspection and marking of reference surfaces.
assumptions: "Granite block feedstock assumed available; uses generic cutting/finishing until stone-specific processes are modeled."
notes: Localized fabrication path replacing import placeholder for granite surface plates.
