    notes: "By-product of Solvay process for sodium carbonate production"
assumptions: |
  Ammonium chloride produced as by-product of Solvay process.
  Reaction: NaCl + NH3 + CO2 + H2O → NaHCO3 + NH4Cl.
  NH4Cl crystallizes from solution and is recovered.
  Can be recycled to recover ammonia via CaO decomposition.
notes: |
  Production of ammonium chloride from Solvay process.
  Critical intermediate for ammonia recycling in lunar ISRU.
  Decomposes with CaO to regenerate NH3 for Haber-Bosch process.
  See ammonia_recovery_cao_v0 for recycling chemistry.
