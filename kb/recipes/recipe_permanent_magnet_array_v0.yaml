    notes: "Permanent magnets (especially rare earth magnets) imported from Earth initially"
assumptions: Rare earth permanent magnets (NdFeB) require complex metallurgy, sintering, and magnetizing equipment. Ferrite magnets are simpler but weaker. Import initially, develop local production as rare earth extraction and processing capability develops.
notes: Permanent magnet arrays for motors, generators, and magnetic separators. Rare earth magnets (NdFeB) offer strongest fields but require complex processing. Ferrite magnets are cheaper and easier to manufacture but have lower field strength.
