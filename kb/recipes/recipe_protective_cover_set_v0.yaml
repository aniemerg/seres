  Manufactures protective cover set for robot pinch points and moving parts.

  Design: Aluminum sheet covers for 6 joint motors, cable guards, gripper guards.
  Total mass: 3 kg covers + fasteners.

  Components:
  - Motor covers (6×): Enclose joint motors and gearboxes
  - Cable guards: Shield cable routing paths
  - Gripper finger guards: Prevent pinching
  - Joint covers: Prevent access to rotating joints

  Process:
  1. Cut 2mm aluminum sheet to patterns
  2. Form into covers using press brake
  3. Deburr edges and drill mounting holes
  4. Add ventilation slots if motors need cooling
  5. Optional: Anodize for corrosion resistance

  Inputs:
  - 3.5 kg aluminum sheet (3 kg final + scrap)
  - 2× fastener kits (screws for tool-required attachment)

  Alternative: Polycarbonate sheet (transparent, impact-resistant) if polymer
  synthesis available. Aluminum chosen as baseline lunar-manufacturable option.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.8.3.
