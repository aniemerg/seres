assumptions: |
  - T-slots machined to standard dimensions (18mm width, 8mm neck, compatible with M12/M16 T-nuts)
  - Table surface ground flat to precision tolerance (<0.05mm flatness)
  - 5-7 parallel T-slots spaced approximately 100mm apart
  - Table dimensions approximately 600mm x 900mm x 80mm thick
  - Material: cast steel with good dimensional stability
  - Finished mass: 60 kg
notes: |
  T-slotted table top for universal workholding and fixturing applications.

  Manufacturing process:
  1. Cast thick steel plate blank (or cut from rolled plate if available)
  2. Face mill both surfaces to establish parallel datum surfaces
  3. Rough machine T-slot channels using end mill and T-slot cutter
  4. Precision grind top surface for flatness tolerance
  5. Finish grind T-slot surfaces for dimensional accuracy
  6. Deburr, clean, and apply rust preventive coating

  T-slot specifications:
  - Slot width: 18mm (standard)
  - Neck width: 8mm
  - Slot depth: 12mm
  - Compatible with M12 and M16 T-nuts and bolts

  Application: Provides versatile clamping surface for machining operations,
  assembly work, inspection, and general fabrication tasks. Critical component
  for machine tool work tables and precision assembly stations.
