    notes: "Import biocide additive; specialty chemical, low mass requirement."
assumptions: |
  Biocides are complex organic compounds requiring specialized synthesis.
  May not be necessary in lunar vacuum environment (no ambient microorganisms).
  Low consumption rate (2% of cutting fluid mass).
notes: |
  Placeholder import path for biocide additive.
  Used in water-based cutting fluid to prevent microbial growth.

  Lunar context: Possibly unnecessary due to sterile vacuum environment.
  Alternative: Increase pH with sodium hydroxide (dual purpose: corrosion + antimicrobial).

  Import justified: Specialty chemical, minimal mass impact, low priority for local production.
