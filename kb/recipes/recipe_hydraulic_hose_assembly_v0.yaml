    notes: "Inspect fittings, verify no leaks, check hose routing"
assumptions: Assembly from bulk hydraulic hose and crimp fittings. Hose may be manufactured locally (rubber extrusion with wire reinforcement) or imported. Fittings machined from steel.
notes: Custom length hydraulic hose assemblies for hydraulic systems. Proper crimping critical for leak-free high-pressure operation. Can be assembled on-site as needed.
