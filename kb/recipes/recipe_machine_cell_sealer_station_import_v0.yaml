    notes: Test sealing mechanism, verify leak-tight closure
assumptions: Cell sealer station fabricated from local materials per BOM. Sealing achieved via crimping or resistance welding. Control panel may use imported electronics initially.
notes: Manufacturing route for battery cell sealing station. Used in Ni-Fe battery assembly process.
