  - process_id: core_memory_threading_process_v0
assumptions: "Seed recipe linking core_memory_threaded_tile_v0 to core_memory_threading_process_v0; actual inputs for the tile fabrication to be defined later."
notes: "Placeholder recipe to enable modeling for threaded core memory tile v0. Will refine as production steps are defined."
