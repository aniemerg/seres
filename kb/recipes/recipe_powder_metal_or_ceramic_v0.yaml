    notes: "Ball mill coarse metal or ceramic feedstock to fine powder (1-100 micron particle size)"
assumptions: "Generic powder production from metal alloy bulk, ceramic materials, or extracted metals. Particle size controlled through grinding time and screen selection."
notes: "Production of fine metal or ceramic powder for sintering, hot pressing, or additive manufacturing applications. Feedstock can be iron, steel, tungsten, alumina, or other materials depending on application."
