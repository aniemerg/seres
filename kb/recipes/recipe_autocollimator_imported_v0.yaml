    notes: "Precision autocollimator imported from Earth due to optical and detector complexity"
assumptions: High-precision optical instrument with specialized detectors and optics not manufacturable in early bootstrapping stages.
notes: Autocollimator for angular alignment and flatness measurements. Import placeholder until local optical manufacturing capability develops.
