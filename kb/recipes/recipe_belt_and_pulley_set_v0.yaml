assumptions: "Belt and pulley power transmission set for motors, conveyors, and machinery drives. 8 kg set includes 2-4 pulleys/sheaves (cast iron or steel, various diameters 50-300 mm) and matching V-belts or flat belts. Typical power capacity 0.5-5 kW. Speed ratios 1:1 to 5:1 achievable. Includes mounting hardware (set screws, keys). Used for flexible power transmission with overload protection (belt slip). Quieter and less expensive than gears."
notes: "Manufacturing of belt and pulley set. Total fabrication time ~15.5 hours. Includes precision pulley machining for proper V-groove profiles or flat surfaces, rubber belt fabrication with reinforcing cords, dynamic balancing, and matching for target speed ratio. Critical component for variable-speed drives and power transmission in machinery."
