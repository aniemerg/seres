kind: recipe
target_item_id: steel_frame_heavy_duty
variant_id: v0
steps:
  - process_id: sheet_metal_cutting_v0
    est_time_hr: 6.0
    labor_hours: 5.0
    machine_hours: 5.0
    notes: Cut plate and tube sections for frame members and mounting points.
  - process_id: welding_brazing_basic_v0
    est_time_hr: 8.0
    labor_hours: 7.0
    machine_hours: 7.0
    notes: Weld box/tube sections into the main chassis; attach brackets and mounts.
  - process_id: stress_relief_annealing_v0
    est_time_hr: 4.0
    labor_hours: 1.0
    machine_hours: 1.0
    notes: Stress relieve weldments to reduce distortion.
assumptions: Uses heavy plate/tube steel feed; detailed fixturing, machining, and coating to be added later. Paint/coating not modeled.
notes: Coarse fabrication route for heavy-duty steel frame; can be refined with downstream machining and coating as BOM is defined.
