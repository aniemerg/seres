    est_time_hr: 0.5
    machine_hours: 0.5
    notes: "Heat treat to develop spring properties. Quench and temper for hardness HRC 38-45 typical."

assumptions: |
  Generic lock washer production for M6-M12 sizes. Process covers 2x size range.
  Starting material: spring steel sheet 1-2mm thick (material_class: steel, high carbon).
  Heat treatment essential for spring function - must achieve proper hardness and resilience.
  Split gap typically 1.5-2x wire thickness.

notes: |
  Split ring lock washer manufacturing requires spring steel and heat treatment.
  Stamping creates the split ring geometry, heat treatment develops spring properties.
  Alternative design: wave washers or toothed lock washers have different geometries
  but serve similar anti-vibration function.
