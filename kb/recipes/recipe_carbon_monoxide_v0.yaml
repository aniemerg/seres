name: Carbon monoxide production via Boudouard reaction
steps:
  - process_id: boudouard_reaction_v0
notes: |
  Produce carbon monoxide via the Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 → 2CO).
  Primary method for CO generation in lunar ISRU.
  Also produced as byproduct in:
  - FFC process (carbon anode oxidation)
  - Syngas generation (steam reforming)
  - Carbothermal reduction processes
