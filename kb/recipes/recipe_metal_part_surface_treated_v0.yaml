assumptions: Surface-treated formed metal part with protective coating or passivation layer. Surface treatment depends on material and application (pickling, degreasing, phosphating, etc.).
notes: Recipe for formed metal parts that require surface protection or preparation for assembly. Used for corrosion-sensitive applications or parts requiring good surface finish.
