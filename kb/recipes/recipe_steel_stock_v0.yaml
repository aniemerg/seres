steps:
  - process_id: iron_smelting_reduction_v0
    notes: Reduce ilmenite/ore with carbon to produce pig iron feedstock.
  - process_id: steel_refining_basic_v0
    notes: Refine pig iron and cast billets/slabs for rolling.
  - process_id: steel_stock_hot_rolling_v0
    notes: Hot roll billets into bar/plate/rod stock and cut to length.
assumptions: "Local steel route using carbothermal iron reduction, basic refining, and hot rolling; energy/time are best-guess placeholders."
notes: "Replaces import placeholder for general steel stock feed used across machining and fabrication."
