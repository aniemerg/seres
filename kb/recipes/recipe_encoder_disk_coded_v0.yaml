    notes: "Machine coded disk with Gray code or binary pattern for absolute position encoding"
assumptions: |
  Precision machining required for accurate pattern placement.
  Gray code or binary encoding pattern etched/machined into disk.
  Pattern may be optical (reflective/transmissive) or magnetic.
notes: |
  Standalone recipe for coded encoder disk intermediate component.
  Typically produced as part of encoder_rotary_absolute recipe, but can be made separately.
  Used in absolute position encoders for robotics and machine control.
