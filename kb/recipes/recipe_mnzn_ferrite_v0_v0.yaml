- process_id: ferrite_powder_synthesis_v0
assumptions: "Seed recipe linking MnZn ferrite production to ferrite powder synthesis; placeholder values."
notes: |-
  This is a seed recipe for MnZn ferrite powder production. The precursor (ferrite_powder_precursor_v0)
  is consumed by ferrite_powder_synthesis_v0 to yield MnZn ferrite powder. Details of the chemistry can be refined later.
