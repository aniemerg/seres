    notes: "Test gate operation and verify hopper capacity"
assumptions: Fabricated hopper with gravity or vibrating discharge mechanism. Design depends on material flow characteristics (free-flowing vs cohesive materials).
notes: Hopper feed systems provide controlled material feeding to processing equipment. Essential for continuous operation of crushers, mills, and other bulk material handling machinery.
