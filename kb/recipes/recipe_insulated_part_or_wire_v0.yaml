    notes: "Test insulation resistance and verify dimensions"
assumptions: Insulated wire produced by extruding polymer insulation over drawn conductor. Can be single conductor or multi-conductor cable. Insulation material depends on voltage and temperature requirements.
notes: Insulated wire and cable for electrical distribution and control wiring. Critical component for all electrical systems. Higher voltage cables require thicker insulation and better dielectric materials.
