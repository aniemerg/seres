steps:
  - process_id: metal_forming_basic_v0
    notes: Form steel sheet/angles into brackets and rails.
  - process_id: welding_basic_v0
    notes: Weld brackets and supports into mounting frame/rails.
  - process_id: surface_finishing_basic_v0
    notes: Deburr and finish mounting surfaces; add protective coating if needed.
assumptions: "Simple welded steel brackets/rails sized for benchtop instrumentation; fasteners handled separately."
notes: Local fabrication route for basic instrument mounts used on test benches.
