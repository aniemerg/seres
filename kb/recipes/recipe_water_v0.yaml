    notes: "Water extracted from lunar polar ice deposits, regolith processing, or imported from Earth"
assumptions: Water can be sourced from lunar polar craters (permanently shadowed regions with ice), extracted from hydrated minerals in regolith, or imported during early bootstrap phase.
notes: Water is a critical resource for cooling systems, hydraulic fluids, life support, and chemical processing. Lunar water extraction reduces dependence on Earth imports.
