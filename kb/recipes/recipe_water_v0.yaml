    notes: "Extract water from polar ice-bearing regolith; melt/condense to collect."
assumptions: Water sourced from lunar polar ice deposits; regolith volatiles or imports are fallback options.
notes: Water is a critical resource for cooling systems, hydraulic fluids, life support, and chemical processing. Lunar water extraction reduces dependence on Earth imports.
