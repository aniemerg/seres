  Import recipe for chromium metal.
  Chromium production via aluminothermic reduction or electrolytic processes is complex
  and requires specialized equipment. Marked as import until local production route is needed.

  Typical production methods:
  - Aluminothermic reduction of Cr2O3 (most common for metal)
  - Electrolysis of chromium chloride
  - Carbothermal reduction followed by purification
