    notes: "Conveyor belt imported from Earth initially - rubber/fabric composite with vulcanized splice"
assumptions: Conveyor belting is a rubber/fabric composite that requires vulcanizing equipment and materials. Can be manufactured locally once rubber production and fabric weaving are established. Imported initially as continuous loop or spliced on-site.
notes: Endless loop conveyor belt for material handling. Rubber and fabric composite provides durability and flexibility. Critical component for all conveyor systems in material handling and processing.
