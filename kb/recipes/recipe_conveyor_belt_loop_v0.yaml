    notes: "Fabricate conveyor belt loop from molded rubber/plastic piece and small conveyor frame"
assumptions: Conveyor belting is being locally manufactured via the new conveyor_belt_loop_fabrication_v0 process; initial belt is derived from rubber/plastic segments.
notes: Endless loop conveyor belt for material handling. Rubber and fabric composite provides durability and flexibility. Critical component for all conveyor systems in material handling and processing.
