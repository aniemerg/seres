assumptions: Large cast iron casting requiring pattern making, sand casting, stress relief, and precision machining. Internal ribbing for rigidity and vibration damping.
notes: Heavy machine tool column providing rigid support for spindle heads and carriages. Cast iron provides excellent vibration damping and dimensional stability for precision machining operations.
