  Import recipe for zero-backlash harmonic drive gearbox.

  Import required: Precision tooth machining (±5 micron accuracy), heat treatment
  in controlled atmosphere, advanced metrology for quality control.

  Critical for robot repeatability (±0.5mm requirement).

  Phase 2 opportunity: Manufacture with precision CNC grinding, CMM inspection,
  and vacuum heat treatment furnace. Steel manufacturable from lunar iron.
