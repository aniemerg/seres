    notes: "Slake lime by adding water to calcium oxide: CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2"
assumptions: "Lime slaking process. Exothermic reaction, requires cooling. Stoichiometric ratio CaO:H2O = 56:18 = 0.76:0.24"
notes: |
  Production of calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) from calcium oxide.

  Reaction: CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2

  Simple hydration process. Heat generated must be dissipated during slaking.
