    notes: "Mount deck to frame, install leveling feet, attach water distribution manifold, test tilt adjustment"
assumptions: Machined steel deck with riffle pattern for gravity separation. Frame supports table with tilt/vibration capability. Total mass ~90 kg.
notes: Separation table assembly for gravity-based mineral processing. Deck with riffles captures dense particles while lighter material is washed away.
