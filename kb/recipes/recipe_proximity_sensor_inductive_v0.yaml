  Manufacturing recipe for inductive proximity sensor.

  Components:
  - LC oscillator coil (wound from copper wire)
  - Sensing electronics (oscillator, detector, output driver on PCB)
  - Metal housing with threaded mount (machined from aluminum)
  - IP67 environmental sealing (potting compound)

  This recipe uses locally manufactured coil and housing, plus
  electronics from standard PCB fabrication processes.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.5.4.
