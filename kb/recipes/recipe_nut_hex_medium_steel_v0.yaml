    notes: "Drill pilot hole and tap internal threads. Chamfer edges for easy thread engagement."

assumptions: |
  Generic hex nut production for M6-M12 sizes. Process covers 2x size range.
  Starting material: steel rod or bar stock (material_class: steel).
  Cold heading preferred for material efficiency and production speed.
  Thread tapping standard for internal threads (thread rolling possible with specialized tooling).

notes: |
  Standard hex nut manufacturing. Cold heading creates hexagonal shape efficiently.
  Tapping creates precise internal threads. For high-volume production, multi-station
  nut formers can combine heading and tapping in continuous operation.
