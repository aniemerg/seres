    notes: "Stock material source for placeholder stock_material"
assumptions: Stock material is a generic placeholder that should be replaced with specific material types (steel_bar, aluminum_plate, ceramic_rod, etc.) in actual recipes. This generic definition allows recipe development before all material types are fully defined.
notes: Placeholder for semi-finished stock materials used in machining and fabrication. In practice, replace with specific material forms like steel_bar, aluminum_sheet, etc.
