    notes: "Hot or cold forge hex head from steel rod/wire stock. Forms head geometry in one or few blows."

    est_time_hr: 0.1
    machine_hours: 0.1
    notes: "Cut threads via thread rolling or turning. Finish shank length and chamfers. Thread rolling preferred for strength."

assumptions: |
  Generic bolt production for M6-M12 sizes. Process covers 2x size range.
  Starting material: steel rod or wire stock (material_class: steel).
  Thread rolling preferred over cutting for superior fatigue strength and surface finish.
  Batch production typical: 50-100 bolts per setup for economy.

notes: |
  Standard hex bolt manufacturing using forging + machining. Forging creates net-shape or
  near-net-shape head, machining creates precise threads and final dimensions. For high-volume
  production, dedicated cold heading and thread rolling machines would be more efficient.
