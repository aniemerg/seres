assumptions: |
  Seed crystals produced from zone-refined single-crystal silicon.
  Zone refining creates initial single crystal with known orientation.
  Multiple small seeds cut from one zone-refined boule.
  Each seed ~1-10g (0.001-0.01 kg), used to grow much larger Czochralski ingots.
notes: |
  Production of silicon seed crystals for Czochralski process.
  Bootstrap approach: zone refining creates initial single crystal.
  Subsequent seeds can be cut from previously-grown Czochralski ingots.
  Critical for semiconductor industry - determines crystal orientation.
  See czochralski_process_silicon_v0 for usage.
