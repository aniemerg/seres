    notes: "Test heating performance and temperature control to ~1200°C"
assumptions: Can be either traditional forge with combustion or induction heater with power electronics. Both capable of reaching forging temperatures.
notes: Heating equipment for metalworking operations. Brings steel to forging temperature (~1200°C).
