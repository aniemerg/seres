  Import recipe for nitrogen gas.

  On the Moon, nitrogen is extremely rare (<100 ppm in regolith).
  Nitrogen must be imported from Earth for:
  - Inert atmosphere applications
  - Chemical synthesis (Haber-Bosch ammonia production)
  - Purge gas for processes

  Earth production: Cryogenic distillation of air (fractional distillation at -196°C)
  separates nitrogen (78% of air) from oxygen and other gases.

  For lunar operations, nitrogen is a critical import until in-situ sources
  (asteroid mining, comet material) become available.
