notes: |
  Production of medium gear set from steel bar stock.

  Process:
  1. Cut gear blanks from steel bar stock (lathe/mill)
  2. Cut gear teeth (gear hobbing or milling)
  3. Heat treat for hardness (optional, depends on application)
  4. Finish and inspect

  Mass: ~60 kg finished gears from 65 kg steel stock (8% machining loss)
assumptions: "Generic medium-sized gear set; gear cutting covers blank machining and tooth cutting; heat treatment optional"
