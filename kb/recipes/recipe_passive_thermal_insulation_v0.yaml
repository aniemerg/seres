  Import recipe for passive thermal insulation.

  High-performance thermal insulation requires:
  - Multi-layer insulation (MLI) with aluminized films
  - Aerogel or advanced foam materials
  - Vacuum-compatible materials

  Marked as import until local production capability is established.
assumptions: "Imported thermal insulation material for lunar applications."
