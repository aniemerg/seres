assumptions: "Adjustable work rest for supporting workpieces during grinding, turning, or machining operations. 10 kg steel construction with precision-machined base, adjustable support arm, height and position adjustment mechanisms, and locking screws. Prevents workpiece deflection during machining. Used on surface grinders, cylindrical grinders, lathes, and other machine tools. Typical adjustment range 50-200 mm height, 0-300 mm position."
notes: "Manufacturing of adjustable work rest. Total fabrication time ~12.5 hours. Requires precision machining for smooth adjustment and stable support. Critical accessory for grinding and turning long or flexible workpieces that need intermediate support to prevent deflection."
