  Import recipe for magnetic core memory tiles.

  Magnetic core memory tile production requires:
  1. Ferrite powder synthesis (NiFe₂O₄ or similar soft ferrite)
  2. Powder processing and pressing into toroidal cores
  3. Sintering at 1200-1400°C
  4. Assembly into array matrix with precise spacing
  5. Wire threading through cores (automated process)

  Challenges for lunar production:
  - Requires precise ferrite composition control
  - Complex automated wire threading machinery
  - Alternative memory technologies (drum, delay line) may be simpler

  Marked as import for bootstrap phase. Local production path exists via:
  - ferrite_toroid_core_v0 (ferrite core production)
  - core_memory_threading_process_v0 (wire threading)

  Consider import until automated threading machinery is established.
