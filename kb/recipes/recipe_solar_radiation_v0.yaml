    notes: "Solar radiation freely available at lunar surface - environmental resource"
assumptions: "Solar radiation is a freely available natural resource at lunar surface. No production steps required - environmental input."
notes: "Solar radiation collection from sun. Approximately 1361 W/m² continuously available at lunar surface during daylight (14 Earth days). No atmosphere means no absorption losses. Used for thermionic power generation and thermal processing."
