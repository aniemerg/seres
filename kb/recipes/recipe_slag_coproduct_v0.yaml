    notes: Slag tapped as coproduct during iron smelting/reduction heat.
assumptions: "Slag is produced alongside iron pig/ingot in reduction furnace; quantities scale with ore and flux chemistry."
notes: Coproduct route for slag from iron smelting; captures slag availability without separate processing step.
