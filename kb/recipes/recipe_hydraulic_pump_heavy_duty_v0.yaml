    notes: "Verify pump displacement, pressure rating, volumetric efficiency, and absence of leaks or noise"
assumptions: "Heavy-duty hydraulic pump for high-pressure, high-flow industrial applications. 80 kg gear or piston pump rated for 200-350 bar operating pressure. Displacement typically 40-100 cc/rev. Used in excavators, large presses, injection molding machines, and heavy mobile equipment. Includes precision-machined pump body, hardened gears/pistons, drive shaft with bearings, high-pressure seals, and mounting flange. Flow rate typically 40-120 L/min."
notes: "Manufacturing of heavy-duty hydraulic pump. Total fabrication time ~64 hours. Requires extensive precision machining for tight internal clearances (critical for high pressure), heat treatment for wear resistance, and rigorous leak testing. More demanding than standard hydraulic pumps due to higher pressures and flows. Critical component for heavy industrial machinery."
