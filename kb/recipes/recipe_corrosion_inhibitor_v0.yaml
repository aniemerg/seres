    notes: "Import corrosion inhibitor; specialty formulation."
assumptions: |
  Corrosion inhibitors are specialty chemical formulations.
  Simple alternatives like sodium nitrite could be synthesized locally from NaOH + HNO3.
  Low consumption rate (3% of cutting fluid mass).
notes: |
  Placeholder import path for corrosion inhibitor.
  Used in water-based cutting fluids to prevent rust and corrosion.

  Future consideration: Synthesize simple inhibitor like sodium nitrite locally
  using available NaOH and nitric acid production.

  Import justified: Low mass requirement, specialty formulation, minimal impact on closure.
