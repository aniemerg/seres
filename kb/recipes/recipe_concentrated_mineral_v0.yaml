assumptions: Beneficiation process to upgrade ore from ~1-10% to 20-70% target mineral. Process selection depends on ore mineralogy (gravity for dense minerals, magnetic for iron, flotation for sulfides).
notes: Mineral concentration reduces mass for smelting and improves efficiency. Essential preprocessing step for all metal extraction operations.
