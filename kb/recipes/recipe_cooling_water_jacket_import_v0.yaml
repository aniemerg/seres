    notes: Pressure test for leaks, verify flow characteristics
assumptions: |
  Copper construction for excellent thermal conductivity.
  TIG welding provides leak-tight joints.
  Brazed fittings withstand operating pressure (assume copper-phosphorus brazing alloy).
  Designed to wrap around heated components (motors, transformers, etc.).
notes: |
  Manufacturing route for cooling water jacket.
  Replaces import_v0 placeholder.
  Fabrication and brazing handled by jacket_with_fittings upstream.
  Suitable for liquid cooling of electrical equipment, motors, reactors.
  Typical operating pressure: 2-5 bar, temperature: 20-60°C.
