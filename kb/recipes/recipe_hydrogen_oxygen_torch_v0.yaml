assumptions: |
  Hydrogen-oxygen torch assembly from machined and welded components.
  Safety-critical design requiring thorough leak testing.
  Refractory nozzle materials withstand 2800°C flame temperatures.
notes: |
  Manufacturing recipe for H2-O2 flame torch used in high-purity silica production.
  Critical safety features: flashback arrestors and pressure monitoring.
  Used in flame hydrolysis processes (silica_glass_high_purity_v0).
