assumptions: "2 kg depth stop mechanism assembly including precision adjustment screw (M12-M16 thread pitch), stop collar (50-80mm diameter), compression spring for preload, lock nut, and steel mounting bracket. Machined from cast steel blanks with precision grinding on critical surfaces for ±0.05mm depth control accuracy."
notes: "Complete six-step fabrication recipe for depth stop mechanism. Process flow: (1) cast metal component blanks, (2) turn cylindrical features and threads, (3) drill mounting and pin holes, (4) mill flat surfaces and finish threads, (5) precision grind critical contact surfaces, (6) final assembly with spring and hardware. Mechanism provides repeatable depth control for drill presses, vertical milling machines, and punch presses."
