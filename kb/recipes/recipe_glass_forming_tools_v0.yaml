assumptions: |
  Steel stock bar/billet is available for forged components; graphite paddles/blocks are supplied as blanks and lightly machined before assembly. Fasteners/grips are generic hardware. Mass target ~5 kg for the full tool set.
notes: Coarse three-step route from steel stock to finished glass-forming hand tool kit; refine with detailed BOM and heat treatment later.
