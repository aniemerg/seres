  Import recipe for air bearing assemblies.

  Air bearing production requires:
  1. Ultra-precision machining (sub-micron flatness)
  2. Lapped and polished bearing surfaces
  3. Precision air gap control (typically 5-20 microns)
  4. Compressed air supply system
  5. Extremely clean manufacturing environment

  Challenges for lunar production:
  - Requires precision beyond current lunar manufacturing capability
  - No atmosphere for air supply (would need local compressed air generation)
  - Contamination from regolith dust is problematic
  - Alternative: Magnetic bearings may be more suitable for lunar environment

  Marked as import for bootstrap phase. Local production requires establishing
  ultra-precision machining capability first.
