assumptions: Pipe threading tool set for manual threading of steel pipes. Threading dies require precision machining and heat treatment for accurate thread forms and long tool life.
notes: Essential tooling for plumbing, hydraulic, and pneumatic system installation. NPT tapered threads provide leak-tight sealed connections without additional sealant (though pipe dope or PTFE tape often used).
