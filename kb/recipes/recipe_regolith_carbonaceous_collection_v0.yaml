    notes: "Collection of carbonaceous chondrite regolith from meteorite impact sites. Rare (1-2% of lunar surface) but critical for carbon and volatile extraction. Slower than generic mining due to site prospecting and travel."
notes: |
  Collection process for carbonaceous regolith from CM/CI chondrite impact sites.
  Targets areas with visible dark material enrichment and organic compound signatures.
  Rich in carbon (2-5%), water (10%), and volatiles - essential for ISRU operations.
