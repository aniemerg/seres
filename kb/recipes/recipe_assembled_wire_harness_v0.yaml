    notes: "Cut and strip wires, crimp terminals, install connectors, route and bundle wires, install strain relief and labels"
assumptions: "Assembled wire harness for equipment wiring and interconnections. 3 kg harness includes signal wires (18-24 AWG), control wires (16-20 AWG), connectors (various types: D-sub, Molex, terminal blocks), cable management (ties, loom), and labels. Lighter duty than cable harness - focused on signal/control rather than power distribution. Custom-built for specific equipment. Simplifies assembly and reduces installation errors."
notes: |
  Manufacturing of assembled wire harness. Total fabrication time ~8.5 hours. Includes wire cutting and stripping, connector crimping/soldering, routing and bundling per wiring diagram, labeling, and electrical testing.
  Pre-assembled harnesses reduce equipment assembly time and improve reliability. Critical for complex equipment with multiple electrical connections.
  Mass balance: assembly step outputs assembled_wire_harness directly.
