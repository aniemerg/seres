# Import path for wire_copper_insulated (non-versioned) until local drawing/insulation path is modeled

    notes: Imported insulated copper wire until insulation/drawing path is modeled.
assumptions: "Wire insulation sourced externally; replace with local copper drawing and insulation path later."
notes: "Import placeholder to support wiring and electrical subsystems modeling."
