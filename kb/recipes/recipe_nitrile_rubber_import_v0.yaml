  Import recipe for nitrile rubber (NBR).

  Nitrile rubber production requires:
  1. Butadiene monomer (from petroleum cracking)
  2. Acrylonitrile monomer (from propylene/ammonia)
  3. Emulsion polymerization reactors
  4. Coagulation and drying equipment

  Challenges for lunar production:
  - No petroleum sources on Moon (hydrocarbons must be synthesized)
  - Complex petrochemical processing chain
  - Energy-intensive synthesis

  Alternatives for local production:
  - Silicone rubber (from lunar silicon + methane)
  - Fluoroelastomers (if fluorine available)
  - EPDM from synthesized ethylene/propylene

  Marked as import for bootstrap phase. Consider silicone rubber as locally-manufacturable alternative.
