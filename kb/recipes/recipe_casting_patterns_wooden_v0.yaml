    notes: "Verify pattern dimensions match casting requirements with draft angles for mold removal"
assumptions: "Pattern construction using binder/polymer material as wood substitute. Includes appropriate draft angles and surface finish for mold making."
notes: "Casting patterns for creating sand mold cavities. Patterns shaped to part geometry plus shrinkage allowance for metal cooling. Uses polymer substitute for wood."
