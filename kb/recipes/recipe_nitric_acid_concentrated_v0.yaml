    notes: "Catalytic oxidation of ammonia to produce concentrated nitric acid"
assumptions: |
  Nitric acid production via Ostwald process.
  Three-stage process: NH3 oxidation → NO oxidation → NO2 absorption in water.
  Catalyst: Tungsten carbide on nickel (lunar alternative to platinum).
  Concentration: 60-70% HNO3 by mass.
notes: |
  Production of concentrated nitric acid from ammonia.
  Ostwald process: NH3 + 2O2 → HNO3 + H2O.
  Critical for chlorine chemistry on the Moon (HCl production from NaCl).
  See ostwald_process_nitric_acid_v0 for detailed chemistry.
