    notes: "Install replaceable teeth, cutting edges, and mounting hardware"
assumptions: Heavy fabrication from structural steel plate with reinforcement. Cutting edges heat treated for wear resistance. Teeth and edges should be replaceable for maintenance.
notes: Excavator bucket for regolith excavation and material handling. Critical equipment for mining operations and construction. Design for high abrasion resistance and ease of maintenance.
