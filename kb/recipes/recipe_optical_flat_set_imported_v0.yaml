    notes: "Imported from Earth due to precision optical polishing requirements"
assumptions: High-precision optical flats require sub-wavelength flatness and parallelism. Imported due to specialized optical polishing and metrology requirements.
notes: Precision optical flat set for interferometric testing. Imported due to extreme flatness requirements (lambda/20 or better).
