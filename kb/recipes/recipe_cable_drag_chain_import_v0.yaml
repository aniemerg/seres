  Import recipe for polymer energy chain (cable carrier).

  Import required: Nylon or polypropylene links (requires polymer synthesis
  from H2 + CO2), hinge pins.

  Phase 2 opportunity: Manufacture metal link version from steel or aluminum
  (heavier but durable). Polymer synthesis from lunar water (H2) + imported
  carbon or Sabatier-produced CO2.
