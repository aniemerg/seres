notes: |
  Extraction of neon gas from lunar regolith volatiles via cryogenic distillation.
  Extremely energy intensive (~200 kWh/kg) and requires massive regolith throughput.
  Concentration: ~0.15 ppm in volatiles (not economical for early ISRU).
  Source process: noble_gas_extraction_v0
  Recommendation: Import from Earth for early phases.
