assumptions: This is a generic placeholder representing electrical equipment that has passed functional testing and burn-in. In actual use, should be replaced with specific equipment types (motor_electric_tested, power_supply_tested, etc.).
notes: Placeholder for quality-verified electrical equipment ready for integration. Uses electrical_testing_basic_v0 process which takes assembled_electrical_equipment as input and produces tested_electrical_equipment as output.
