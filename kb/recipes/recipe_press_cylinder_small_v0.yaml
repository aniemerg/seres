target_item_id: press_cylinder_small
variant_id: v0
steps:
  - process_id: machining_finish_basic_v0
  - process_id: sealing_and_assembly_basic_v0
  - process_id: pressure_test_basic_v0
assumptions: "Small press cylinder build uses standard machining, sealing, and pressure testing steps; tolerances aligned for press application."
notes: "Manufacture press_cylinder_small via typical hydraulic cylinder process chain; adapted for small press usage."
