assumptions: Metal powders can also be produced by atomization (spraying molten metal into inert gas or water). Ceramic powders produced by grinding, precipitation, or sol-gel methods. This recipe assumes mechanical grinding route.
notes: Powder feedstock for additive manufacturing, powder metallurgy pressing and sintering, thermal spray coating, and metal injection molding. Particle size and morphology critical for process success.
