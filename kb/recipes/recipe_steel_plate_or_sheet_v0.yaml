    est_time_hr: 0.5
    labor_hours: 0.5
    notes: "Check thickness, flatness, and surface quality"
assumptions: Steel plate/sheet production from steel ingots via hot rolling. Plate is >6mm thick, sheet is <6mm. Cold rolling can be added for improved surface finish and dimensional control.
notes: Steel plate and sheet stock for fabrication, structural components, and enclosures. Essential material for machine frames, tanks, and general fabrication work.
