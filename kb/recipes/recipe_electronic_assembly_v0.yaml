assumptions: Electronic assembly from populated PCB and enclosure. Components (ICs, resistors, capacitors) are imported initially. Local PCB fabrication and assembly capability develops over time.
notes: Generic electronic assembly placeholder for control boards, power supplies, and electronic modules. Critical for automation and process control systems.
