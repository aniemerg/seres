    notes: "Verify gauge accuracy across full tension range, check repeatability and linearity"
assumptions: "Tension gauge for measuring wire, cable, or belt tension in manufacturing and installation applications. 2 kg mechanical or electronic gauge. Typical tension ranges: 10-500 N (light duty) or 100-5000 N (heavy duty). Includes calibrated spring mechanism, lever system, dial indicator or digital display, and tension contacts. Accuracy ±2-5% of full scale. Used in wire drawing, fiber spinning, belt drives, and cable installations."
notes: "Manufacturing of tension gauge. Total fabrication time ~11.5 hours. Precision machining of mechanical components, spring calibration, assembly, and final calibration against force standards. Critical for quality control in wire and fiber production processes."
