    notes: "Verify glove flexibility, port ring mounting fit, and seal quality"
assumptions: "Glove port assemblies for glove box controlled atmosphere enclosures. 3 kg set includes 2-4 port assemblies (standard 8-inch diameter). Metal port rings (aluminum or stainless steel) with butyl rubber or neoprene gloves bonded for airtight seal. Long-cuff gloves allow manipulation inside glove box while maintaining inert atmosphere or vacuum. Used in materials processing, electronics assembly, and chemical handling."
notes: "Manufacturing of glove ports and gloves for glove box. Total fabrication time ~10.5 hours. Critical component for maintaining controlled atmosphere in sensitive processing operations. Seal integrity is essential - leak testing required."
