    notes: Abstract placeholder - computing time is available as a resource for software development
assumptions: |
  Computing time represents available CPU/development hours.
  Not manufactured - inherently available as a resource.
  This recipe is a placeholder to satisfy KB closure requirements.
notes: |
  Placeholder recipe for abstract computing time resource.
  Used in software development processes as a consumable input.
  Represents developer time + compute resources for code development.
