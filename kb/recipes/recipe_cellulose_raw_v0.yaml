    notes: "Import raw cellulose from Earth; organic feedstock."
assumptions: |
  Cellulose is organic plant material not available on lunar surface.
  Requires plant biomass processing facilities (pulping, purification).
  Future alternatives: bacterial/algae production in later phases.
notes: |
  Placeholder import path for raw cellulose material.
  Used as feedstock for CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) synthesis in battery binder production.
  Import justified per Conservative Mode: no local organic matter available in initial bootstrap phase.
