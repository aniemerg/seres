assumptions: "Industrial heating element set for high-temperature furnaces and ovens. 20 kg set includes multiple heavy-duty resistance coils (nichrome/kanthal alloy wire) or silicon carbide rods. Rated for 10-50 kW total power at 800-1600°C operating temperature. Alumina or SiC ceramic insulators included. Used in heat treatment furnaces, sintering ovens, and high-temperature processing."
notes: "Manufacturing of industrial heating element set. Total fabrication time ~37 hours. Requires heavy-gauge wire drawing, precision coil winding for high power capacity, high-temperature ceramic insulator production, and robust terminal assembly. More demanding than basic heating elements due to higher power and temperature requirements. Critical for industrial thermal processing."
