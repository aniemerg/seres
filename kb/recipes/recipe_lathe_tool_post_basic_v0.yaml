    est_time_hr: 1.0
    machine_hours: 0.5
    labor_hours: 0.5
    notes: "Drill and tap holes for mounting bolts, height adjustment screws, and tool clamping bolts. Drill pin holes for alignment features."
  - process_id: heat_treatment_hardening_v0
    est_time_hr: 2.0
    machine_hours: 1.5
    labor_hours: 0.5
    notes: "Heat treat tool post body to increase hardness and wear resistance. Focus on contact surfaces and clamping areas."
  - process_id: precision_grinding_basic_v0
    est_time_hr: 1.5
    machine_hours: 1.0
    labor_hours: 0.5
    notes: "Precision grind mounting base for perpendicularity to tool axis. Grind tool holder reference surfaces for accurate tool positioning."
  - process_id: assembly_basic_v0
    est_time_hr: 1.0
    labor_hours: 1.0
    notes: "Assemble tool post components: install height adjustment mechanism, tool holder wedges or turret, clamping screws with hardened washers. Test clamping force and tool holder repeatability."
assumptions: Steel bar stock or block available. Heat treatment capability for hardening. Tool holder inserts or wedges fabricated separately.
notes: Fabrication of basic tool post for manual engine lathe. Enables secure mounting and quick changing of cutting tools for various turning operations.
