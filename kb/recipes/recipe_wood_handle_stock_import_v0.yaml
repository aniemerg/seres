  Import recipe for wood handle stock.

  Wood is not available on the Moon and would need to be either:
  1. Imported from Earth
  2. Grown in pressurized greenhouses/habitats (long growth time)
  3. Replaced with alternatives:
     - Bamboo (faster growing, can be cultivated)
     - Composite materials (fiberglass, carbon fiber)
     - Metal handles (aluminum, steel)

  For bootstrap phase, mark as import. Consider composite or metal alternatives
  for local production.
