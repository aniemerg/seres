    notes: "Import path: derive Ni(OH)2 precursor for battery active material from meteoritic feed via nickel extraction."
assumptions: "Meteorite-derived nickel precursor; downstream hydration/precipitation steps to produce Ni(OH)2 will be modeled later."
notes: "Placeholder import recipe enabling local modeling of nickel compound active material."
