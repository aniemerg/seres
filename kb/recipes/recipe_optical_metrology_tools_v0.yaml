    notes: "High-precision optical metrology instruments imported from Earth due to optical component complexity and interferometric precision requirements"
assumptions: Optical metrology tools require precision optical components, interferometers, autocollimators, and laser systems that are beyond early-stage manufacturing capability. Import until optical manufacturing infrastructure is established.
notes: Comprehensive optical metrology toolkit for precision alignment and measurement. Essential for solar concentrator alignment, thermionic device optimization, and quality control of optical systems.
