    notes: "Assembled locally from imported components"
assumptions: Optical metrology tools require precision optical components, interferometers, autocollimators, and laser systems that are beyond early-stage manufacturing capability. Import until optical manufacturing infrastructure is established.
notes: Comprehensive optical metrology toolkit for precision alignment and measurement. Essential for solar concentrator alignment, thermionic device optimization, and quality control of optical systems.
