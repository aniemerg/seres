    notes: "Verify hardness, diameter, runout, and surface finish specifications"
assumptions: Large work rolls for rolling mills require forging, heat treatment, and precision grinding. Critical for producing flat, dimensionally accurate rolled products.
notes: Hardened rolling cylinders are the working elements of rolling mills. Surface quality and hardness directly impact product quality and roll life. Regular regrinding required to maintain surface finish.
