assumptions: "Set of resistive heating elements for kilns, furnaces, and ovens. 20 kg set includes multiple coil elements wound from nichrome or kanthal alloy wire (NiCr 80/20 or FeCrAl). Ceramic insulator supports included. Suitable for temperatures up to 1100-1200°C. Power rating typically 5-15 kW total for small-medium furnaces."
notes: "Manufacturing of basic heating element set. Total fabrication time ~18 hours. Includes wire drawing from alloy stock, precision coil winding to achieve target resistance, ceramic insulator fabrication, and final assembly. Critical component for all thermal processing equipment (kilns, furnaces, ovens, dryers)."
