    notes: "Import temperature sensors (thermocouples, RTDs, pyrometers) and signal conditioning electronics"
assumptions: Temperature sensors and electronics imported. Thermocouples can be fabricated from wire, but signal conditioning requires electronics.
notes: Temperature sensing equipment for high-temperature process monitoring. Import placeholder pending electronics capability.
