steps:
  - process_id: metal_forming_basic_v0
    notes: Roll and weld steel plate/tube to rough cylinder blank with end caps.
  - process_id: machining_precision_v0
    notes: Bore/hone cylinder interior, machine ports and mounting surfaces.
  - process_id: stress_relief_annealing_v0
    notes: Heat soak to relieve welding/machining stresses prior to sealing and testing.
assumptions: "Simplified cylinder build using formed/welded shell followed by precision machining; seals/rods handled via assembly processes elsewhere."
notes: "Local build route for medium hydraulic press cylinder. Uses existing forming/machining/anneal processes; pressure sealing details deferred."
