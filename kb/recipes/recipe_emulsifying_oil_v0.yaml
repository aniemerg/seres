  Import recipe for emulsifying oil.
  Emulsifying oils are specialized petroleum products containing surfactants and emulsifiers.
  Production requires:
  - Petroleum refining for base oil
  - Synthesis or extraction of emulsifying agents (fatty acid soaps, sulfonates)
  - Formulation and blending

  Marked as import due to complexity of petroleum processing and surfactant synthesis.
