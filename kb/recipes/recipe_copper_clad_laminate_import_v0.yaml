kind: recipe
target_item_id: copper_clad_laminate
variant_id: import_v0
steps:
  - process_id: import_placeholder_v0
assumptions: "Copper-clad laminate sourced externally; placeholder path to enable PCB-laminate-based builds."
notes: "Import placeholder to support PCB fabrication path; replace with local copper_clad_laminate production later if modeled."
