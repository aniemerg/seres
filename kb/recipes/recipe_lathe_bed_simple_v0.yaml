steps:
  - process_id: casting_or_fabrication_machine_frame_v0
    est_time_hr: 4.0
    machine_hours: 3.0
    labor_hours: 2.0
    notes: "Cast iron bed with integral ways and mounting surfaces. Pattern includes core for hollow sections to reduce mass while maintaining rigidity."
  - process_id: machining_basic_v0
    est_time_hr: 3.0
    machine_hours: 2.5
    labor_hours: 1.5
    notes: "Rough machining of mounting surfaces, way surfaces, and bolt hole patterns. Leaves stock for final precision grinding."
  - process_id: precision_grinding_and_scraping_v0
    est_time_hr: 6.0
    machine_hours: 4.0
    labor_hours: 3.5
    notes: "Precision grind V-ways and flat way to straightness within 0.02mm per meter. Hand scrape critical bearing surfaces for optimal flatness and oil retention."
  - process_id: assembly_basic_v0
    est_time_hr: 1.0
    labor_hours: 1.0
    notes: "Install leveling pads, chip pan mounting brackets, and protective way covers. Final inspection and alignment verification."
assumptions: Cast iron material available with suitable composition for machine tool applications. Pattern-making capability assumed for casting process.
notes: Fabrication of simplified lathe bed for compact engine lathe. Precision ways enable accurate carriage motion for turning operations.
