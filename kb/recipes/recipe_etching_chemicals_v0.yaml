  Import recipe for etching chemicals.

  Etching chemicals for PCB fabrication and metal etching include:
  - Ferric chloride (FeCl3)
  - Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8)
  - Cupric chloride (CuCl2)
  - Photoresist developers

  Requires chemical synthesis, purification, and quality control.
  Complex chemical process. Marked as import.
assumptions: "Etching chemicals for PCB fabrication and metal etching. Can be synthesized from base chemicals or imported."
