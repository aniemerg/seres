kind: recipe
# Converted import stub into a local production recipe to resolve the gap
# and provide a concrete production path for conductive additive.

  - process_id: conductive_additive_production_v0
    est_time_hr: 1.0
assumptions: Local carbon-based production path; this path replaces the previous import stub as data matures.
notes: Replaced import placeholder with a real production process for conductive additive.
