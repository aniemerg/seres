# Converted import stub into a local production recipe to resolve the gap
# and provide a concrete production path for conductive additive.

  - process_id: conductive_additive_production_v0
    inputs:
      - item_id: carbon_reductant
        qty: 1.0
        unit: kg
    outputs:
      - item_id: conductive_additive

assumptions: Local carbon-based production path; this path replaces the previous import stub as data matures.
notes: Replaced import placeholder with a real production process for conductive additive.
