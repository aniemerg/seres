    notes: Imported seal material for high-temp reactor interfaces until local synthesis is defined.
assumptions: "Treats sealant as imported consumable; update with actual synthesis or bonding process later."
notes: "Ensures reactor seal material is available in the graph with an explicit import placeholder."
