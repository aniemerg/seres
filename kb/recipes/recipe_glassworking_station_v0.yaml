assumptions: Glassworking station for lampworking and glass fabrication. Uses oxy-fuel or hydrogen-oxygen torch for heating glass. Annealing oven required to relieve thermal stress.
notes: Versatile glassworking station for making vacuum tubes, insulators, laboratory glassware, and optical components. Critical for electronics manufacturing (vacuum tube envelopes) and chemical processing (lab glassware).
