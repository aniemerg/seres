  Complete fastener manufacturing from steel stock to finished kit. Process integrates:
  - Wire/rod drawing for bolt and nut starting material
  - Hot forging for head formation (hex heads on bolts, upset blanks for nuts)
  - Thread cutting via single-point turning (bolts) and tapping (nuts)
  - Sheet metal stamping for washer production
  - Heat treatment for strength and hardness
  - Final sorting and kitting

  Input materials: 1.1 kg steel stock (0.9 kg rod/wire, 0.2 kg sheet)
  Output: 1.0 kg complete fastener kit per BOM specification
  Scrap rate: ~9% from machining chips, stamping waste, and heat treatment losses

  Comprehensive seven-step recipe for fastener_kit_medium production.

  Kit composition per bom_fastener_kit_medium_v0:
  - 720g hex bolts M6-M12 in various lengths (76 pieces total)
  - 180g hex nuts M6-M12 (135 pieces total)
  - 75g flat washers M6-M12 (135 pieces total)
  - 30g lock washers M6-M12 (60 pieces total)
  Total: ~366 fasteners, 1.0 kg net weight

  Manufacturing process details:
  1. Wire drawing: Reduce bar stock to bolt shank diameters (6mm, 8mm, 10mm, 12mm)
  2. Forging: Form hex heads on bolt blanks, upset nut blanks for adequate thread engagement
  3. Threading: Cut external threads on bolts (dies or single-point), tap nuts (spiral point taps)
  4. Washer stamping: Progressive die stamps flat and lock washers from sheet
  5. Heat treatment: Quench and temper bolts to grade 8.8 equivalent, harden lock washers
  6. Finishing: Vibratory tumbling removes scale and burrs
  7. Kitting: Sort by size, verify counts, package in compartmented container

  Total time: ~9 hours (primarily sequential, some parallel opportunity for washers)
