assumptions: "Assemble heating/cooling modules (heater, cryocooler, temp control) into reactor system; refer to BOM for subcomponents; temperature_control_system_v0 and cryocooler_active_v0 used as seed components."
notes: "Top-level recipe to assemble reactor heating/cooling system from standard unit operations."
