  notes: "Wind copper winding around air core to form inductor"
assumptions: |
  Air-core inductor: winding of copper wire around an air core. No ferromagnetic core. Placeholder mass/dimensions; refinement needed as data becomes available.
notes: Basic winding operation for inductors; does not specify insulation details or final enclosure.
