    notes: "Gas byproduct path from catalyst regeneration process; mass balance placeholder."
assumptions: "Gas byproduct path; rely on catalyst_regeneration_process_v0; refine as data becomes available."
notes: "Placeholder recipe to produce regeneration_gas_v0 via catalyst_regeneration_process_v0; used to unblock mass balance modeling."
