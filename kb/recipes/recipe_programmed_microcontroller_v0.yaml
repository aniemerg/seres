    notes: "Microcontroller ICs imported from Earth and programmed on-site, or imported pre-programmed"
assumptions: Semiconductor fabrication requires cleanroom facilities, photolithography, doping, and advanced process control beyond early-stage manufacturing. Microcontrollers are imported until semiconductor fab capability is established.
notes: Microcontrollers provide embedded control for motors, sensors, communication systems, and process automation. Programming can be done locally with imported programmer hardware.
