    machine_hours: 0.8
    notes: Form tank body/panels from plastic sheet or extrusion.
  - process_id: machining_finish_basic_v0
    est_time_hr: 0.4
    labor_hours: 0.3
    machine_hours: 0.4
    notes: Cut/drill ports, brackets, and fixture points.
  - process_id: assembly_basic_v0
    est_time_hr: 0.4
    labor_hours: 0.4
    machine_hours: 0.2
    notes: Assemble bath, plumbing, and basic agitation/heater mounts.
assumptions: Uses plastic stock plus imported heaters/pumps; chemistry handled separately. Sized for bench-scale PCB tinning/plating.
notes: Simple fabrication route for a tinning/plating bath; refine with materials and safety controls later.
