  oxygen_liquid:
    density_kg_per_m3: 1141
    notes: Liquid oxygen at boiling point
  water:
    density_kg_per_m3: 1000

notes: '- Densities are approximate and vary by alloy/composition

  - Used by unit converter to convert mass ↔ volume

  - For precise calculations, use specific alloy densities

  - Lunar regolith densities are for loose material (compacted is higher)
