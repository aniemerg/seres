notes: "Cryogenic storage tanks for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2).\n\
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/papers_gap_seed_v0 (rocket propellant storage)\nTanks:\
  \ Separate LOX and LH2 tanks with vacuum insulation\nLOX tank: ~1000 L capacity,\
  \ -183\xB0C operating temperature\nLH2 tank: ~3000 L capacity, -253\xB0C operating\
  \ temperature\nInsulation: Vacuum-jacketed double-wall construction, MLI (multi-layer\
  \ insulation)\nMaterials: Aluminum alloy for compatibility and thermal properties\n\
  Pressure: 2-5 bar typical for pressurized feed systems\nBoiloff: <1% per day with\
  \ proper insulation\nApplications: Rocket propellant storage, fuel cell feedstock,\
  \ industrial gas storage\nSafety: Pressure relief valves, vent systems, leak detection\n\
  Critical for: Rocket launch capability, long-term cryogenic storage\n"
