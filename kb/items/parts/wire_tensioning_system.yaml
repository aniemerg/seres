kind: part
name: Wire tensioning system
mass: 5.0
unit: kg
material_class: steel
notes: "System for maintaining constant tension on wire during winding or threading\
  \ operations.\nSource: Referenced by core_memory_threading_machine_v0 and wire winding\
  \ processes\nComponents: Spring-loaded tensioner or weighted arm mechanism\nFunction:\
  \ Prevents wire slack, breakage, and ensures consistent winding tension\nTension\
  \ range: 10-500g typical for fine wire operations\nAdjustment: Spring compression\
  \ or weight adjustment for different wire gauges\nApplications:\n  - Core memory\
  \ threading (maintains consistent wire routing)\n  - Transformer winding (even coil\
  \ layers)\n  - Cable manufacturing (consistent cable properties)\nDesign: Pulley\
  \ or guide with spring or weight providing constant tension force\nCritical for:\
  \ Quality wire-wound components, precision assembly\n"
