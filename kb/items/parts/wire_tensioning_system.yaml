kind: part
name: Wire tensioning system
mass: 5.0
unit: kg
material_class: steel
notes: |
  System for maintaining constant tension on wire during winding or threading operations.
  Source: Referenced by core_memory_threading_machine_v0 and wire winding processes
  Components: Spring-loaded tensioner or weighted arm mechanism
  Function: Prevents wire slack, breakage, and ensures consistent winding tension
  Tension range: 10-500g typical for fine wire operations
  Adjustment: Spring compression or weight adjustment for different wire gauges
  Applications:
    - Core memory threading (maintains consistent wire routing)
    - Transformer winding (even coil layers)
    - Cable manufacturing (consistent cable properties)
  Design: Pulley or guide with spring or weight providing constant tension force
  Critical for: Quality wire-wound components, precision assembly
