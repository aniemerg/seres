  Set of protective covers for robot pinch points and moving mechanisms.

  Prevents accidental contact with rotating motors, gears, and pinch points
  between moving arm segments. Required by machinery safety directives.

  Components:
  - Motor covers (6×): Enclosures for each joint motor/gearbox
    - Material: Polycarbonate (transparent) or aluminum sheet
    - Fastening: Tool-required (screws) to prevent casual removal
    - Ventilation: Slots or perforations (if motors need air cooling)
  - Cable guards: Protective shields over cable routing paths
  - Gripper finger guards: Prevent pinching between gripper jaws
  - Joint covers: Prevent access to rotating joints

  Design considerations:
  - Must not interfere with robot motion (adequate clearance)
  - Tool-required removal (prevents bypassing during operation)
  - Visual access for inspection (transparent where possible)
  - Easy removal for maintenance

  Materials:
  - Polycarbonate sheet: 3mm thick, impact-resistant (preferred for visibility)
  - Aluminum sheet: 2mm thick (opaque but durable)
  - Stainless steel mesh: For ventilated covers

  Manufacturing: Sheet metal forming or polymer thermoforming. Polycarbonate
  likely import initially. Aluminum from lunar resources. Fasteners (screws)
  from steel.
