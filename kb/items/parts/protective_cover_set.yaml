notes: "Set of protective covers for robot pinch points and moving mechanisms.\n\n\
  Prevents accidental contact with rotating motors, gears, and pinch points\nbetween\
  \ moving arm segments. Required by machinery safety directives.\n\nComponents:\n\
  - Motor covers (6\xD7): Enclosures for each joint motor/gearbox\n  - Material: Polycarbonate\
  \ (transparent) or aluminum sheet\n  - Fastening: Tool-required (screws) to prevent\
  \ casual removal\n  - Ventilation: Slots or perforations (if motors need air cooling)\n\
  - Cable guards: Protective shields over cable routing paths\n- Gripper finger guards:\
  \ Prevent pinching between gripper jaws\n- Joint covers: Prevent access to rotating\
  \ joints\n\nDesign considerations:\n- Must not interfere with robot motion (adequate\
  \ clearance)\n- Tool-required removal (prevents bypassing during operation)\n- Visual\
  \ access for inspection (transparent where possible)\n- Easy removal for maintenance\n\
  \nMaterials:\n- Polycarbonate sheet: 3mm thick, impact-resistant (preferred for\
  \ visibility)\n- Aluminum sheet: 2mm thick (opaque but durable)\n- Stainless steel\
  \ mesh: For ventilated covers\n\nManufacturing: Sheet metal forming or polymer thermoforming.\
  \ Polycarbonate\nlikely import initially. Aluminum from lunar resources. Fasteners\
  \ (screws)\nfrom steel.\n\nDesign reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section\
  \ 3.8.3.\n"
