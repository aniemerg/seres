kind: part
name: Tungsten cathode (coated)
mass: 0.2
unit: kg
material_class: ceramic
notes: Sintered tungsten cathode with calcium oxide (CaO) coating for enhanced thermionic
  emission. Used in thermionic converters for direct thermal-to-electrical energy
  conversion. The CaO coating reduces work function and improves electron emission
  efficiency.
