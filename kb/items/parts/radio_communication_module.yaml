notes: |
  Radio communication module for short-range wireless data transmission (imported).

  Includes RF transceiver, antenna, signal processing, and digital interface.
  Used for rover-to-rover communication, telemetry, and control signals.

  Marked as import due to:
  - Complex RF design and antenna engineering requirements
  - Signal processing and digital interface complexity
  - Requires electronics fabrication infrastructure beyond early manufacturing capability

  Future ISRU alternative: Requires PCB fabrication, RF component manufacturing, and assembly capabilities.
