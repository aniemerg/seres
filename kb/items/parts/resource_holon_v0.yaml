notes: "Resource holon - autonomous agent for manufacturing resource management.\n\
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0, holonic manufacturing\
  \ systems\nConcept: Self-organizing manufacturing control paradigm\nHolon types:\n\
  \  - Resource holons: Manage physical manufacturing resources (machines, tools,\
  \ materials)\n  - Product holons: Represent product requirements and processes\n\
  \  - Order holons: Manage production tasks and schedules\nResource holon functions:\n\
  \  - Monitor resource state (available, busy, maintenance)\n  - Accept and reject\
  \ production tasks based on capability\n  - Negotiate with other holons for scheduling\n\
  \  - Report status and performance\nAdvantages: Decentralized control, flexible\
  \ scheduling, fault tolerance\nImplementation: Agent-based software running on local\
  \ controller\nCommunication: Peer-to-peer messaging between holons\nApplications:\
  \ Flexible manufacturing, self-organizing factories, autonomous production\nLunar\
  \ context: Essential for autonomous self-replicating factory operation\nCritical\
  \ for: Factory autonomy, adaptive scheduling, fault recovery\n"
