  Resource holon - autonomous agent for manufacturing resource management.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0, holonic manufacturing systems
  Concept: Self-organizing manufacturing control paradigm
  Holon types:
    - Resource holons: Manage physical manufacturing resources (machines, tools, materials)
    - Product holons: Represent product requirements and processes
    - Order holons: Manage production tasks and schedules
  Resource holon functions:
    - Monitor resource state (available, busy, maintenance)
    - Accept and reject production tasks based on capability
    - Negotiate with other holons for scheduling
    - Report status and performance
  Advantages: Decentralized control, flexible scheduling, fault tolerance
  Implementation: Agent-based software running on local controller
  Communication: Peer-to-peer messaging between holons
  Applications: Flexible manufacturing, self-organizing factories, autonomous production
  Lunar context: Essential for autonomous self-replicating factory operation
  Critical for: Factory autonomy, adaptive scheduling, fault recovery
