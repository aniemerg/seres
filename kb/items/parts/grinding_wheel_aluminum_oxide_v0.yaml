notes: 'Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) abrasive grinding wheel for cylindrical grinding operations.


  Imported for same reasons as generic grinding_wheels (see that item for details).


  Specifications:

  - Abrasive: Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), brown or white

  - Grit size: Typically 60-120 for general grinding

  - Bond: Vitrified ceramic bond

  - Application: Cylindrical grinding, tool sharpening, general metalworking

  - Consumable: Requires periodic dressing and replacement


  Advantages of Al2O3 grinding wheels:

  - General purpose, works well on ferrous metals (steel, cast iron)

  - Good toughness, maintains sharp cutting edges

  - Widely available and cost-effective

  - Brown Al2O3: Tougher, for roughing operations

  - White Al2O3: Friable (self-sharpening), cooler grinding


  For early bootstrapping, import high-quality aluminum oxide grinding wheels.
