  Thermal circuit breaker for automatic overcurrent protection.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0
  Principle: Bimetallic strip heats and bends under overcurrent, trips mechanism
  Components: Bimetallic element, latch mechanism, contacts, reset lever
  Rating: 5-50A typical at 120-240V AC/DC
  Trip time: Inverse time characteristic (faster at higher overcurrent)
  Reset: Manual reset after cooling and fault clearing
  Advantages: Simple, reliable, no external power needed, reusable
  Applications: Motor protection, power distribution, equipment safety
  Temperature compensation: Some designs compensate for ambient temperature
  Lunar context: Simple electromechanical device, locally manufacturable
  Critical for: Electrical safety, fault protection, equipment preservation
