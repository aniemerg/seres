id: vacuum_tube_triode_v0
kind: part
name: Triode vacuum tube v0
mass: 0.05
unit: kg
material_class: composite
notes: "Three-element vacuum tube (cathode, grid, anode) for amplification and switching.\n\
  Source: Referenced by various electronic equipment (signal generators, radios, computers)\n\
  Elements:\n  - Cathode: Emits electrons when heated (oxide-coated or thoriated tungsten)\n\
  \  - Control grid: Modulates electron flow\n  - Anode (plate): Collects electrons\n\
  Function: Amplifier or switch controlled by grid voltage\nAmplification factor (μ):\
  \ 5-100 typical\nApplications:\n  - Audio amplifiers\n  - RF amplifiers\n  - Oscillators\n\
  \  - Switching circuits\n  - Computing (logic gates in vacuum tube computers)\n\
  Advantages: Radiation-hard, high voltage capability, simple manufacturing\nDisadvantages:\
  \ Power hungry, large, limited lifetime (cathode depletion)\nLunar context: Manufactureable\
  \ from local materials, radiation-tolerant electronics\nLifetime: 1000-10,000 hours\
  \ typical\nCritical for: Electronics in radiation environment, vacuum-compatible\
  \ circuits\n"
