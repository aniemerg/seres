kind: part
name: Triode vacuum tube v0
mass: 0.05
unit: kg
material_class: composite
notes: |
  Three-element vacuum tube (cathode, grid, anode) for amplification and switching.
  Source: Referenced by various electronic equipment (signal generators, radios, computers)
  Elements:
    - Cathode: Emits electrons when heated (oxide-coated or thoriated tungsten)
    - Control grid: Modulates electron flow
    - Anode (plate): Collects electrons
  Function: Amplifier or switch controlled by grid voltage
  Amplification factor (μ): 5-100 typical
  Applications:
    - Audio amplifiers
    - RF amplifiers
    - Oscillators
    - Switching circuits
    - Computing (logic gates in vacuum tube computers)
  Advantages: Radiation-hard, high voltage capability, simple manufacturing
  Disadvantages: Power hungry, large, limited lifetime (cathode depletion)
  Lunar context: Manufactureable from local materials, radiation-tolerant electronics
  Lifetime: 1000-10,000 hours typical
  Critical for: Electronics in radiation environment, vacuum-compatible circuits
