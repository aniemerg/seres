notes: "Electric 2-finger parallel jaw gripper for robotic manipulation.\n\nParallel\
  \ jaw motion ensures part remains centered during gripping.\n\nSpecifications:\n\
  - Type: Electric (motor-driven)\n- Jaw stroke: 120 mm total (60 mm per finger)\n\
  - Gripping force: 200 N (adjustable)\n- Fingers: Interchangeable soft/hard jaws\n\
  - Repeatability: \xB10.2 mm\n\nComponents:\n- Aluminum body housing\n- Ball screw\
  \ mechanism (driven by stepper motor)\n- Two parallel finger slides with linear\
  \ bearings\n- Interchangeable jaw inserts (rubber, aluminum, or custom)\n- Jaw position\
  \ encoder\n- Force sensor (strain gauge or current sensing)\n\nActuation: NEMA 23\
  \ stepper motor with ball screw drive.\n\nMounting: ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 flange or\
  \ quick-change interface.\n\nManufacturing: Aluminum body from lunar Al. Ball screw\
  \ precision machining.\nStepper motor requires magnets (import). Bearings and encoder\
  \ import.\n\nDesign reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.6.1.\n"
