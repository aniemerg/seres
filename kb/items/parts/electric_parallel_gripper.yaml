  Electric 2-finger parallel jaw gripper for robotic manipulation.

  Parallel jaw motion ensures part remains centered during gripping.

  Specifications:
  - Type: Electric (motor-driven)
  - Jaw stroke: 120 mm total (60 mm per finger)
  - Gripping force: 200 N (adjustable)
  - Fingers: Interchangeable soft/hard jaws
  - Repeatability: ±0.2 mm

  Components:
  - Aluminum body housing
  - Ball screw mechanism (driven by stepper motor)
  - Two parallel finger slides with linear bearings
  - Interchangeable jaw inserts (rubber, aluminum, or custom)
  - Jaw position encoder
  - Force sensor (strain gauge or current sensing)

  Actuation: NEMA 23 stepper motor with ball screw drive.

  Mounting: ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 flange or quick-change interface.

  Manufacturing: Aluminum body from lunar Al. Ball screw precision machining.
  Stepper motor requires magnets (import). Bearings and encoder import.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.6.1.
