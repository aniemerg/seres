  Absolute rotary encoder for position sensing without homing.

  Function: Tracks shaft position absolutely (knows position after power-on).
  Technology: Multi-turn absolute encoder with magnetic or optical sensing.
  Output: Digital position value (e.g., 12-16 bit resolution, ~360-4096 steps/rev).
  Interface: Digital output (SSI, Gray code, or simple binary).

  Key advantage over incremental: No homing/reference needed after power cycle.
  Critical for: Antenna pointing, solar tracking, robotic joints requiring position memory.

  Construction:
    - Sensing element (Hall effect or optical disk with coded pattern)
    - Signal processing electronics
    - Mechanical shaft coupling
    - Housing and connector

  Conservative Mode check completed:
  - Searched for: encoder, rotary sensor, position sensor
  - Checked items: encoder_magnetic_v0 (0.1kg - generic magnetic),
    encoder_optical_simple_v0 (0.15kg - incremental optical)
  - No existing absolute encoder found
  - Created because: Absolute functionality is distinct from incremental encoders
    (different coding disk/electronics needed)
  - Mass estimate: Slightly heavier than simple encoders due to absolute encoding
    electronics and multi-bit output circuitry
