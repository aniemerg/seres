notes: "Absolute rotary encoder for position sensing without homing.\n\nFunction:\
  \ Tracks shaft position absolutely (knows position after power-on).\nTechnology:\
  \ Multi-turn absolute encoder with magnetic or optical sensing.\nOutput: Digital\
  \ position value (e.g., 12-16 bit resolution, ~360-4096 steps/rev).\nInterface:\
  \ Digital output (SSI, Gray code, or simple binary).\n\nKey advantage over incremental:\
  \ No homing/reference needed after power cycle.\nCritical for: Antenna pointing,\
  \ solar tracking, robotic joints requiring position memory.\n\nConstruction:\n \
  \ - Sensing element (Hall effect or optical disk with coded pattern)\n  - Signal\
  \ processing electronics\n  - Mechanical shaft coupling\n  - Housing and connector\n\
  \nConservative Mode check completed:\n- Searched for: encoder, rotary sensor, position\
  \ sensor\n- Checked items: encoder_magnetic_v0 (0.1kg - generic magnetic),\n  encoder_optical_simple_v0\
  \ (0.15kg - incremental optical)\n- No existing absolute encoder found\n- Created\
  \ because: Absolute functionality is distinct from incremental encoders\n  (different\
  \ coding disk/electronics needed)\n- Mass estimate: Slightly heavier than simple\
  \ encoders due to absolute encoding\n  electronics and multi-bit output circuitry\n\
