  Flat optical mirror for microscope illumination path.

  Imported due to precision optics manufacturing requirements:
  - Optical-grade glass substrate (low defects, homogeneous)
  - Precision grinding and polishing (λ/10 surface flatness, <10nm RMS roughness)
  - Optical coating deposition (aluminum or silver, vacuum deposition)
  - Interferometric metrology for surface quality verification
  - Clean room environment to prevent contamination

  Manufacturing requirements:
  - Surface flatness: Better than λ/10 (wavelength/10, ~60nm for visible light)
  - Surface roughness: <10nm RMS (for good reflectivity)
  - Coating: Vacuum-deposited aluminum (88-92% reflectivity) or silver (>95%)
  - Coating thickness: 100-200nm aluminum or 80-120nm silver
  - Protective overcoat: SiO2 or other dielectric (optional, prevents oxidation)

  Applications:
  - Microscope illumination (beam steering, fold mirrors)
  - Optical metrology systems
  - Laser beam steering
  - Interferometry reference surfaces

  Local manufacturing path (future, advanced):
  - Basalt glass substrate production (lower quality than commercial optical glass)
  - CNC grinding and polishing (requires precision machine tools)
  - Vacuum deposition system for reflective coating
  - Interferometric testing equipment
  - Still challenging for early lunar base due to precision requirements

  For early bootstrapping, high-quality optical flats must be imported.
