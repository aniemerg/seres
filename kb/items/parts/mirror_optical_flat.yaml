material_class: glass
is_import: true
notes: "Flat optical mirror for microscope illumination path.\n\nImported due to precision\
  \ optics manufacturing requirements:\n- Optical-grade glass substrate (low defects,\
  \ homogeneous)\n- Precision grinding and polishing (\u03BB/10 surface flatness,\
  \ <10nm RMS roughness)\n- Optical coating deposition (aluminum or silver, vacuum\
  \ deposition)\n- Interferometric metrology for surface quality verification\n- Clean\
  \ room environment to prevent contamination\n\nManufacturing requirements:\n- Surface\
  \ flatness: Better than \u03BB/10 (wavelength/10, ~60nm for visible light)\n- Surface\
  \ roughness: <10nm RMS (for good reflectivity)\n- Coating: Vacuum-deposited aluminum\
  \ (88-92% reflectivity) or silver (>95%)\n- Coating thickness: 100-200nm aluminum\
  \ or 80-120nm silver\n- Protective overcoat: SiO2 or other dielectric (optional,\
  \ prevents oxidation)\n\nApplications:\n- Microscope illumination (beam steering,\
  \ fold mirrors)\n- Optical metrology systems\n- Laser beam steering\n- Interferometry\
  \ reference surfaces\n\nLocal manufacturing path (future, advanced):\n- Basalt glass\
  \ substrate production (lower quality than commercial optical glass)\n- CNC grinding\
  \ and polishing (requires precision machine tools)\n- Vacuum deposition system for\
  \ reflective coating\n- Interferometric testing equipment\n- Still challenging for\
  \ early lunar base due to precision requirements\n\nFor early bootstrapping, high-quality\
  \ optical flats must be imported.\n"
