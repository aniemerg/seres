  Principle: Resistance of nickel wire increases linearly with temperature

  Temperature range: -60°C to +180°C (typical)

  Advantages: Lunar-manufacturable (Ni from meteorites), good linearity

  Construction: Fine nickel wire wound on insulating substrate

  More limited range than thermocouples but better accuracy in its range
