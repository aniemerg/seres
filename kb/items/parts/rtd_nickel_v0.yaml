name: Nickel RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) v0
mass: 0.02
unit: kg
material_class: metal
notes: "Nickel resistance temperature detector for precision temperature measurement.\n\
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/ISRU-sensors_missing_tech.md\nPrinciple: Resistance of\
  \ nickel wire increases linearly with temperature\nTemperature range: -60\xB0C to\
  \ +180\xB0C (typical)\nAdvantages: Lunar-manufacturable (Ni from meteorites), good\
  \ linearity\nConstruction: Fine nickel wire wound on insulating substrate\nMore\
  \ limited range than thermocouples but better accuracy in its range\n"
