kind: part
name: Encoder PCB assembled (intermediate)
mass: 0.06
unit: kg
material_class: electronic
notes: |
  Intermediate product: Assembled encoder electronics PCB.

  Manufacturing stage: After component assembly, before mechanical assembly.
  This is a pure intermediate in encoder manufacturing process.

  Contains: Hall sensors/photodetectors, decoder IC, output driver circuits.

  Status: Internal manufacturing step, not a final product.
  Used in: recipe_encoder_rotary_absolute_v0 (step 1 output → step 3 input)

  Conservative Mode: Created as intermediate item to satisfy recipe flow.
  Standalone recipe mirrors the production step in encoder recipe for KB closure.
provenance: hand_assumption
recipe: recipe_encoder_pcb_assembled_v0
