name: Encoder PCB assembled (intermediate)
mass: 0.06
unit: kg
material_class: electronic
notes: "Intermediate product: Assembled encoder electronics PCB.\n\nManufacturing\
  \ stage: After component assembly, before mechanical assembly.\nThis is a pure intermediate\
  \ in encoder manufacturing process.\n\nContains: Hall sensors/photodetectors, decoder\
  \ IC, output driver circuits.\n\nStatus: Internal manufacturing step, not a final\
  \ product.\nUsed in: recipe_encoder_rotary_absolute_v0 (step 1 output \u2192 step\
  \ 3 input)\n\nConservative Mode: Created as intermediate item to satisfy recipe\
  \ flow.\nStandalone recipe mirrors the production step in encoder recipe for KB\
  \ closure.\n"
