kind: machine
name: Heat rejection radiator
mass: 250.0
unit: unit
material_class: steel
notes: 'Large radiator panel assembly for passive heat rejection via thermal radiation.
  Critical component for thermionic power systems where 70-90% of input thermal energy
  becomes waste heat. High surface area radiator panels with high emissivity coating
  maximize heat dissipation to space. See: design/solar_thermionics_report.md'
