material_class: steel
notes: 'Steel drill pipe sections for drilling operations.


  Drill string consists of:

  - Drill pipe sections: Heavy-wall seamless steel tubes

  - Tool joints: Threaded connections between sections

  - Typical section: 3-6m length, 50-100mm diameter

  - Wall thickness: 8-15mm for strength and torque transmission


  Function:

  - Transmit rotary motion from surface to drill bit

  - Provide hydraulic conduit for drill fluid circulation

  - Enable addition/removal of sections as hole deepens

  - Withstand tension, compression, and torsion loads


  Construction:

  - Material: High-strength steel (often alloy steel)

  - Threaded ends (API standard or proprietary threads)

  - Internal upset for strength at connections

  - Surface hardening for wear resistance


  Lunar drilling context:

  - Drilling into frozen regolith at polar craters

  - Rock-hard ice at ~40K requires robust drill string

  - Typical depth: 0.5-2 meters for water ice extraction

  - Mass estimate: 100 kg for complete drill string set
