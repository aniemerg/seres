kind: part
name: Heat exchanger tube bundle (thermal storage)
mass: 100.0
unit: kg
material_class: steel
notes: "Bundle of heat exchanger tubes for thermal storage applications.\n\nFunction:\
  \ Transfer heat to/from thermal storage medium (regolith, rocks, molten salt).\n\
  Configuration: Coiled or serpentine stainless steel tubing bundle.\nTypical specs:\
  \ 1-2\" diameter tubes, wall thickness 2-4mm, total length 50-200m.\nOperating range:\
  \ 200-600\xB0C for regolith thermal storage.\nEmbedded in: Packed bed thermal storage,\
  \ molten salt tanks, rock bed storage.\n\nApplications:\n  - Solar thermal storage\
  \ systems\n  - Industrial waste heat recovery\n  - Thermal energy buffering\n\n\
  Conservative Mode check completed:\n- Searched for: heat exchanger, tube bundle,\
  \ heat pipes, tubing\n- Checked items: heat_exchanger_tube_shell (30kg - different,\
  \ includes shell),\n  heat_pipes_set (15kg - different, sealed phase-change),\n\
  \  metal_tubing_stock (raw material, not formed)\n- No equivalent found for large\
  \ tube bundles for thermal storage\n- Created because: Specific to thermal storage\
  \ applications, much larger scale\n  than existing heat exchangers, different configuration\
  \ (embedded vs packaged)\n- Mass estimate: Based on typical thermal storage coil\
  \ mass (~1-1.5 kg/m of tube)\n\nReferenced by: recipe_machine_solar_thermal_storage_system_v0\n"
