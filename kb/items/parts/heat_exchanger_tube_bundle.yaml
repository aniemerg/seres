kind: part
name: Heat exchanger tube bundle (thermal storage)
mass: 100.0
unit: kg
material_class: steel
notes: |
  Bundle of heat exchanger tubes for thermal storage applications.

  Function: Transfer heat to/from thermal storage medium (regolith, rocks, molten salt).
  Configuration: Coiled or serpentine stainless steel tubing bundle.
  Typical specs: 1-2" diameter tubes, wall thickness 2-4mm, total length 50-200m.
  Operating range: 200-600°C for regolith thermal storage.
  Embedded in: Packed bed thermal storage, molten salt tanks, rock bed storage.

  Applications:
    - Solar thermal storage systems
    - Industrial waste heat recovery
    - Thermal energy buffering

  Conservative Mode check completed:
  - Searched for: heat exchanger, tube bundle, heat pipes, tubing
  - Checked items: heat_exchanger_tube_shell (30kg - different, includes shell),
    heat_pipes_set (15kg - different, sealed phase-change),
    metal_tubing_stock (raw material, not formed)
  - No equivalent found for large tube bundles for thermal storage
  - Created because: Specific to thermal storage applications, much larger scale
    than existing heat exchangers, different configuration (embedded vs packaged)
  - Mass estimate: Based on typical thermal storage coil mass (~1-1.5 kg/m of tube)
