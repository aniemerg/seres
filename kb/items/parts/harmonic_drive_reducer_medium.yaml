notes: |
  High-precision harmonic drive gear reducer for robot joints.

  Zero-backlash design critical for ±0.5mm repeatability requirement.

  Variants:
  - Large: 100:1 ratio, 50mm diameter, for joints 1-3 (base, shoulder, elbow)
  - Small: 80:1 ratio, 40mm diameter, for joints 4-6 (wrist)

  Components:
  - Wave generator (elliptical cam with bearing)
  - Flexspline (thin-walled cup with external teeth)
  - Circular spline (rigid ring with internal teeth)

  Materials: High-strength alloy steel (flexspline), tool steel (circular spline).

  Manufacturing: Precision machining + heat treatment. Requires controlled
  atmosphere furnace and advanced metrology for tooth accuracy.

  Initially import. Lunar manufacturing possible with precision grinding
  and heat treatment capability.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.2.2.
