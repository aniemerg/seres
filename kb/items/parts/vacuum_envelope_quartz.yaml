  Mass updated 2026-01 from 15.0 kg to 1.0 kg based on recipe analysis.
  Recipe uses 1 kg of fused_silica_glass to make 1 unit of envelope.
  Note: BOM_pete_photon_enhanced_thermionic_v0 may need correction - it lists 15.0 kg
  which seems incorrect for a discrete quartz envelope.

  Quartz glass vacuum envelope component for PETE converter; used to maintain high vacuum and optical
  transmission.
