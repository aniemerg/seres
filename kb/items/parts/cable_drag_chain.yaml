kind: part
name: Cable drag chain
mass: 1.5
unit: kg
material_class: polymer
notes: |
  Polymer energy chain for cable management in robotic systems.

  Protects cables from wear during repeated flexing motion as robot moves.
  Guides cables in controlled radius bend, preventing kinking or abrasion.

  Specifications:
  - Type: Enclosed drag chain (energy chain, cable carrier)
  - Length: 2 m per chain
  - Inner dimensions: 50mm × 50mm (cross-section for cable bundle)
  - Bend radius: 150 mm minimum
  - Material: Nylon or polypropylene (wear-resistant polymer)

  Construction:
  - Articulated links (hinged chain segments)
  - Enclosed on all sides (top, bottom, sides)
  - Snap-together assembly for easy cable installation
  - Mounting brackets on each end

  Typical installation:
  - One chain from base to shoulder joint (J1-J2)
  - One chain from shoulder to elbow joint (J2-J3)
  - Cables from J3 onward routed through arm structure

  Manufacturing: Injection molding (polymer). Requires polymer synthesis
  (from hydrogen + carbon) or import. Hinge pins from steel or aluminum.
