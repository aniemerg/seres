name: Cable drag chain
mass: 1.5
unit: kg
material_class: polymer
is_import: true
notes: "Polymer energy chain for cable management in robotic systems.\n\nProtects\
  \ cables from wear during repeated flexing motion as robot moves.\nGuides cables\
  \ in controlled radius bend, preventing kinking or abrasion.\n\nSpecifications:\n\
  - Type: Enclosed drag chain (energy chain, cable carrier)\n- Length: 2 m per chain\n\
  - Inner dimensions: 50mm \xD7 50mm (cross-section for cable bundle)\n- Bend radius:\
  \ 150 mm minimum\n- Material: Nylon or polypropylene (wear-resistant polymer)\n\n\
  Construction:\n- Articulated links (hinged chain segments)\n- Enclosed on all sides\
  \ (top, bottom, sides)\n- Snap-together assembly for easy cable installation\n-\
  \ Mounting brackets on each end\n\nTypical installation:\n- One chain from base\
  \ to shoulder joint (J1-J2)\n- One chain from shoulder to elbow joint (J2-J3)\n\
  - Cables from J3 onward routed through arm structure\n\nManufacturing: Injection\
  \ molding (polymer). Requires polymer synthesis\n(from hydrogen + carbon) or import.\
  \ Hinge pins from steel or aluminum.\n\nDesign reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md\
  \ section 3.7.3.\n"
