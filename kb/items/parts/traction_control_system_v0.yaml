  Traction control system for lunar rover wheel slip management.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0, rover autonomy
  Purpose: Prevent wheel slip on loose regolith, optimize traction
  Components:
    - Wheel speed sensors (encoders on each wheel)
    - Motor current sensors (detect high slip via current spikes)
    - Control computer (implements traction control algorithm)
    - Motor controllers (modulate individual wheel torque)
  Algorithm: Detect slip, reduce torque to slipping wheel, redistribute to gripping wheels
  Slip detection: Compare wheel speeds, detect deviation from expected speed
  Response: Reduce motor torque, apply differential braking if available
  Advantages: Prevents getting stuck, improves mobility on slopes, reduces energy waste
  Applications: Rovers, construction vehicles, material transport
  Lunar context: Critical for regolith terrain (loose, variable traction)
  Implementation: Electronic control, no hydraulic systems (vacuum compatible)
  Critical for: Rover mobility, mission success, energy efficiency
