notes: "Traction control system for lunar rover wheel slip management.\nSource: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0,\
  \ rover autonomy\nPurpose: Prevent wheel slip on loose regolith, optimize traction\n\
  Components:\n  - Wheel speed sensors (encoders on each wheel)\n  - Motor current\
  \ sensors (detect high slip via current spikes)\n  - Control computer (implements\
  \ traction control algorithm)\n  - Motor controllers (modulate individual wheel\
  \ torque)\nAlgorithm: Detect slip, reduce torque to slipping wheel, redistribute\
  \ to gripping wheels\nSlip detection: Compare wheel speeds, detect deviation from\
  \ expected speed\nResponse: Reduce motor torque, apply differential braking if available\n\
  Advantages: Prevents getting stuck, improves mobility on slopes, reduces energy\
  \ waste\nApplications: Rovers, construction vehicles, material transport\nLunar\
  \ context: Critical for regolith terrain (loose, variable traction)\nImplementation:\
  \ Electronic control, no hydraulic systems (vacuum compatible)\nCritical for: Rover\
  \ mobility, mission success, energy efficiency\n"
