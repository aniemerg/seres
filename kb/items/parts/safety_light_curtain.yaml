  Optical safety light curtain for industrial robot work cell protection.

  Creates invisible barrier of infrared light beams. If person enters protected
  area (breaking beams), robot immediately stops.

  Specifications:
  - Type: Type 4 safety light curtain (IEC 61496)
  - Coverage: 2m × 2m work cell perimeter
  - Resolution: 30 mm (minimum detectable object)
  - Response time: <100 ms (detection to safety output)
  - Range: Up to 5m between emitter and receiver
  - Safety rating: SIL 2, Category 3 (ISO 13849)

  Components:
  - Emitter unit:
    - Array of infrared LEDs (850 nm wavelength)
    - Synchronization electronics
    - Mounting bracket
  - Receiver unit:
    - Array of photodiodes aligned with emitter LEDs
    - Signal processing (detects beam interruption)
    - Safety output relay (dual-channel)
    - Status indicators (green = OK, red = beam blocked)
  - Mounting posts (2×): Vertical posts at work cell corners
  - Controller/interface module:
    - Connects to safety PLC
    - Provides muting and blanking functions
    - Configuration switches

  Operation: If any beam blocked, safety output opens within 100ms, triggering
  Safe Torque Off to robot. Green light indicates system operational.

  Manufacturing: Optoelectronics (LEDs, photodiodes) import required.
  Signal processing electronics import. Mounting hardware from lunar aluminum.
