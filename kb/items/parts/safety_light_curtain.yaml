notes: "Optical safety light curtain for industrial robot work cell protection.\n\n\
  Creates invisible barrier of infrared light beams. If person enters protected\n\
  area (breaking beams), robot immediately stops.\n\nSpecifications:\n- Type: Type\
  \ 4 safety light curtain (IEC 61496)\n- Coverage: 2m \xD7 2m work cell perimeter\n\
  - Resolution: 30 mm (minimum detectable object)\n- Response time: <100 ms (detection\
  \ to safety output)\n- Range: Up to 5m between emitter and receiver\n- Safety rating:\
  \ SIL 2, Category 3 (ISO 13849)\n\nComponents:\n- Emitter unit:\n  - Array of infrared\
  \ LEDs (850 nm wavelength)\n  - Synchronization electronics\n  - Mounting bracket\n\
  - Receiver unit:\n  - Array of photodiodes aligned with emitter LEDs\n  - Signal\
  \ processing (detects beam interruption)\n  - Safety output relay (dual-channel)\n\
  \  - Status indicators (green = OK, red = beam blocked)\n- Mounting posts (2\xD7\
  ): Vertical posts at work cell corners\n- Controller/interface module:\n  - Connects\
  \ to safety PLC\n  - Provides muting and blanking functions\n  - Configuration switches\n\
  \nOperation: If any beam blocked, safety output opens within 100ms, triggering\n\
  Safe Torque Off to robot. Green light indicates system operational.\n\nManufacturing:\
  \ Optoelectronics (LEDs, photodiodes) import required.\nSignal processing electronics\
  \ import. Mounting hardware from lunar aluminum.\n\nDesign reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md\
  \ section 3.8.2.\n"
