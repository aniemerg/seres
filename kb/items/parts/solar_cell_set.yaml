  Set of photovoltaic solar cells for assembly into solar arrays.
  Imported item - semiconductor fabrication requires advanced cleanroom manufacturing.

  Conservative Mode check:
  - Searched for: solar_cell, pv_cell, photovoltaic
  - Found pv_module_imported (25 kg complete module) - not equivalent for this use
  - Creating as import due to semiconductor complexity

  Typical solar cells are thin silicon wafers with:
  - P-N junction doping
  - Anti-reflective coating
  - Metal contact grid
  - Back surface field

  ISRU alternative would require: silicon purification, crystal growth, wafer slicing,
  doping (phosphorus/boron), metallization, and encapsulation.
