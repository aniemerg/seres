  Set of photovoltaic solar cells for assembly into solar arrays.

  Typical solar cells are thin silicon wafers with:
  - P-N junction doping
  - Anti-reflective coating
  - Metal contact grid
  - Back surface field

  ISRU path assumes: silicon purification, crystal growth, wafer slicing,
  phosphorus doping, metallization, and encapsulation.
