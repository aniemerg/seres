  fitting assembly processes.\n\nConservative Mode check completed:\n- Searched for:\
  \ machined_part_raw (2 kg, 10\xD7 too large), small metal parts\n- Checked: hose_end_fittings_v0\
  \ (0.25 kg, finished product not raw)\n- No equivalent found within 5\xD7 magnitude\
  \ (0.04-1.0 kg range)\n- Created as specific intermediate product for fitting assembly\n\
