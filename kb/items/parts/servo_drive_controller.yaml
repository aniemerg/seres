  Motor controller for brushless DC servo motors in robotic systems.

  Field-oriented control (FOC) for precise position, velocity, and torque control.

  Specifications:
  - Type: 3-phase BLDC servo drive
  - Communication: EtherCAT real-time bus (1 kHz update rate)
  - Control modes: Position, velocity, torque
  - Power rating: Up to 500W per drive
  - Protection: Current limiting, regenerative braking, over-temperature

  Features:
  - Digital encoder interface (20-bit absolute)
  - Safe Torque Off (STO) safety input
  - Status LEDs and diagnostics

  Manufacturing: Complex power electronics and microcontroller. Import required
  for semiconductors and control ICs.
