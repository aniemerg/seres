notes: |
  Assortment of basic electronic components for circuit assembly.

  Imported due to semiconductor fabrication complexity requiring:
  - Cleanroom environments (Class 100-10000)
  - Photolithography equipment (UV/EUV exposure systems)
  - Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) systems
  - Ion implantation for doping
  - Advanced metrology and inspection tools
  - Ultra-pure silicon wafer processing

  Components included:
  - Passive: Resistors, capacitors, inductors
  - Active semiconductors: Diodes, transistors, MOSFETs
  - Integrated circuits: Voltage regulators, op-amps, logic gates
  - Other: LEDs, connectors, switches

  Applications: Control circuits, power supplies, sensor interfaces, communication modules

  Local manufacturing path (future):
  - Phase 1: Import all components (current)
  - Phase 2: Manufacture simple passives (resistors, capacitors) from local materials
  - Phase 3: Vacuum tube technology for active components (bootstrap alternative)
  - Phase 4: Semiconductor fab facility (advanced infrastructure)

  Note: Some passive components may be manufacturable earlier than active semiconductors.
