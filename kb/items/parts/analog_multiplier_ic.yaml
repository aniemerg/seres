  Analog multiplier integrated circuit for analog computing applications.

  Conservative Mode check:
  - Searched for: multiplier, analog IC, computing ICs
  - No equivalent found (operational amplifiers serve different function)
  - Required for analog backpropagation circuit hardware

  Function: Multiplies two analog voltage signals (V_out = k × V1 × V2)

  Applications: Analog computing, signal processing, modulation

  Examples: AD633 (4-quadrant multiplier), MPY634 (precision multiplier)

  Import justified: Requires advanced semiconductor fabrication
  (CMOS or bipolar process, laser trimming for precision)

  Placeholder mass based on typical IC package weight.

  Created per Conservative Mode: specialized component, no local fabrication capability.
