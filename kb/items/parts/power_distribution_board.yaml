notes: "Power distribution board for robotic systems.\n\nRoutes 48V DC from main power\
  \ supply to multiple motor controllers.\n\nComponents:\n- PCB with copper bus bars\
  \ (high current capacity)\n- Circuit breakers (6\xD7 thermal, one per motor)\n-\
  \ Status indicator LEDs\n- Screw terminal blocks for connections\n\nRatings:\n-\
  \ Input: 48V DC from main supply\n- Outputs: 6\xD7 isolated circuits with individual\
  \ breakers\n- Current: 50A total capacity\n\nManufacturing: PCB fabrication (copper\
  \ traces), assembly of breakers and\nterminals. Copper from lunar resources, breakers\
  \ likely import.\n\nDesign reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.3.2.\n"
