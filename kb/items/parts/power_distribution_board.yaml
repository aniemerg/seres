  Power distribution board for robotic systems.

  Routes 48V DC from main power supply to multiple motor controllers.

  Components:
  - PCB with copper bus bars (high current capacity)
  - Circuit breakers (6× thermal, one per motor)
  - Status indicator LEDs
  - Screw terminal blocks for connections

  Ratings:
  - Input: 48V DC from main supply
  - Outputs: 6× isolated circuits with individual breakers
  - Current: 50A total capacity

  Manufacturing: PCB fabrication (copper traces), assembly of breakers and
  terminals. Copper from lunar resources, breakers likely import.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.3.2.
