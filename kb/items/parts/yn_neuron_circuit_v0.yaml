name: YN Neuron Circuit Module
kind: part
mass: 0.5                 # kg (placeholder estimate)
material_class: electronic

# Provenance and uncertainty (placeholders until BOM/specs defined)
dimensions: "unspecified"
mass_source: ai_estimate
mass_confidence: low
notes: |
  Placeholder YN neuron circuit module with resistor networks, referenced in the seed
  comprehension of neural electronics for lunar ISRU. Mass is a conservative estimate to
  enable mass-balance modeling; will be refined with a formal BOM/recipe after design.
