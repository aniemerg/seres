  Mechanical coupling for rapid tool exchange on robot wrist.

  Allows robot to automatically swap between gripper, vacuum cup, screwdriver,
  welding torch, or other end effectors without human intervention.

  Specifications:
  - Standard: ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 mounting pattern (or proprietary)
  - Coupling method: Pneumatic lock/unlock or manual latch
  - Electrical: 8-pin connector for power + signals (automatic mating)
  - Payload: 20 kg maximum
  - Repeatability: ±0.05 mm (critical for tool calibration)

  Components:
  - Master half (on robot wrist): locking mechanism, electrical connector
  - Tool half (on each end effector): mating surface, connector pins
  - Pneumatic valve or manual lever for lock/unlock
  - Tool detection sensor (reed switch or optical)

  Operation: Robot positions tool over coupling, pushes down to engage,
  pneumatic valve activates lock. Electrical connector mates automatically.

  Manufacturing: Steel precision machining for mating surfaces. Pneumatic
  valve import. Electrical connector import. Locking mechanism manufacturable.
