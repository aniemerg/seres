material_class: steel
recipe: recipe_quick_change_tool_interface_v0
notes: "Mechanical coupling for rapid tool exchange on robot wrist.\n\nAllows robot\
  \ to automatically swap between gripper, vacuum cup, screwdriver,\nwelding torch,\
  \ or other end effectors without human intervention.\n\nSpecifications:\n- Standard:\
  \ ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 mounting pattern (or proprietary)\n- Coupling method: Pneumatic\
  \ lock/unlock or manual latch\n- Electrical: 8-pin connector for power + signals\
  \ (automatic mating)\n- Payload: 20 kg maximum\n- Repeatability: \xB10.05 mm (critical\
  \ for tool calibration)\n\nComponents:\n- Master half (on robot wrist): locking\
  \ mechanism, electrical connector\n- Tool half (on each end effector): mating surface,\
  \ connector pins\n- Pneumatic valve or manual lever for lock/unlock\n- Tool detection\
  \ sensor (reed switch or optical)\n\nOperation: Robot positions tool over coupling,\
  \ pushes down to engage,\npneumatic valve activates lock. Electrical connector mates\
  \ automatically.\n\nManufacturing: Steel precision machining for mating surfaces.\
  \ Pneumatic\nvalve import. Electrical connector import. Locking mechanism manufacturable.\n\
  \nDesign reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.6.3.\n"
