notes: "Large precision-ground granite surface plate for metrology and inspection.\
  \ Extremely flat surface (\xB10.01 mm over 1 meter) used as dimensional reference.\
  \ Granite provides thermal stability and wear resistance. Used as base for coordinate\
  \ measuring machines, surface grinders, and precision assembly. Requires lapping\
  \ and scraping to achieve flatness specification."
