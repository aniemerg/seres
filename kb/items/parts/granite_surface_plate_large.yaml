notes: Large precision-ground granite surface plate for metrology and inspection. Extremely flat surface (±0.01 mm over 1 meter) used as dimensional reference. Granite provides thermal stability and wear resistance. Used as base for coordinate measuring machines, surface grinders, and precision assembly. Requires lapping and scraping to achieve flatness specification.
