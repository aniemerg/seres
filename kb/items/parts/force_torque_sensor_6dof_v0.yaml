notes: |
  Six degree-of-freedom force and torque sensor for robotic manipulation.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0
  Measures: 3 forces (Fx, Fy, Fz) + 3 torques (Tx, Ty, Tz)
  Technology: Strain gauge bridge on compliant element
  Principle: Mechanical structure deforms under load, strain gauges measure deformation
  Compliant element: Machined aluminum or steel with flexures
  Strain gauges: Typically 24-48 gauges in Wheatstone bridge configuration
  Range: ±50N forces, ±5Nm torques (typical for assembly tasks)
  Resolution: 0.1N force, 0.01Nm torque
  Applications: Robot assembly, contact detection, force feedback, impedance control
  Critical for: Delicate manipulation, part insertion, surface following
  Lunar context: Essential for autonomous assembly and construction tasks
