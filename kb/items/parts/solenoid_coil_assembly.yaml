kind: part
name: Solenoid coil assembly
mass: 0.15
unit: kg
material_class: electronic
notes: |
  Electromagnetic coil assembly for solenoid valve actuation.

  Components:
  - Copper wire coil wound on bobbin
  - Ferromagnetic core (steel or iron)
  - Thermoplastic bobbin/spool
  - Electrical terminals/leads
  - Protective encapsulation

  Function:
  - Creates magnetic field when energized
  - Pulls plunger/armature to open or close valve
  - Typical current: 0.5-2A
  - Typical voltage: 12-24 VDC or 120/240 VAC

  Construction:
  - Wire gauge: 18-24 AWG (depends on voltage)
  - Turns: 500-2000 (depends on specification)
  - Resistance: 5-50 ohms typical
  - Insulation: Polyimide or enamel coating

  Applications:
  - Solenoid valves for gas/fluid control
  - Automated process control
  - Safety shutdown systems

  Mass estimate: Larger than relay coil (0.05 kg) due to higher power requirements
