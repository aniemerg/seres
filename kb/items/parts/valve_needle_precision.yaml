name: Precision needle valve
mass: 0.3
unit: kg
material_class: metal
notes: "Small precision needle valve for fine flow control applications.\n\nFunction:\
  \ Provides precise, adjustable flow control via tapered needle and seat.\nApplications:\
  \ Gas flow control, instrument control, torch regulation.\nTypical size: 1/4\" to\
  \ 1/2\" port connections.\nMaterials: Brass or stainless steel body, hardened needle.\n\
  Operating range: Low to medium pressure (0-3000 PSI).\n\nConservative Mode check\
  \ completed:\n- Searched for: needle valve, precision valve, flow control valve\n\
  - Checked items: flow_controller_valve_set (different - is a set),\n  valve_set_gas_handling\
  \ (different - shutoff/safety valves),\n  expansion_valve_cryogenic (different -\
  \ cryogenic specific)\n- No equivalent found for small precision needle valves\n\
  - Created because: Required for brazing torch fine flame control,\n  serves different\
  \ function than existing valve sets\n- Mass estimate: Based on typical small industrial\
  \ needle valves (0.2-0.5 kg)\n\nReferenced by: recipe_brazing_torch_oxy_fuel_v0\n"
