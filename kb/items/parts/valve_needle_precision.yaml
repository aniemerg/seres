unit: kg
material_class: metal
notes: |
  Small precision needle valve for fine flow control applications.

  Function: Provides precise, adjustable flow control via tapered needle and seat.
  Applications: Gas flow control, instrument control, torch regulation.
  Typical size: 1/4" to 1/2" port connections.
  Materials: Brass or stainless steel body, hardened needle.
  Operating range: Low to medium pressure (0-3000 PSI).

  Conservative Mode check completed:
  - Searched for: needle valve, precision valve, flow control valve
  - Checked items: flow_controller_valve_set (different - is a set),
    valve_set_gas_handling (different - shutoff/safety valves),
    expansion_valve_cryogenic (different - cryogenic specific)
  - No equivalent found for small precision needle valves
  - Created because: Required for brazing torch fine flame control,
    serves different function than existing valve sets
  - Mass estimate: Based on typical small industrial needle valves (0.2-0.5 kg)
