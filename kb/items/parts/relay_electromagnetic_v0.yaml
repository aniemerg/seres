  Electromagnetic relay for switching electrical loads.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0
  Principle: Electromagnet pulls armature to close/open contacts
  Components: Coil, iron core, armature, contacts, spring, housing
  Coil voltage: 12V, 24V, or 120V AC/DC typical
  Contact rating: 5-30A at 120-240V AC
  Applications: Motor control, power switching, safety interlocks, logic circuits
  Advantages: Galvanic isolation, high voltage/current switching, proven technology
  Disadvantages: Mechanical wear, slower than solid-state, audible click
  Lunar context: Simple electromechanical device, manufacturable with local materials
  Lifetime: 100,000-1,000,000 operations typical
  Critical for: Machine control, safety systems, power distribution
