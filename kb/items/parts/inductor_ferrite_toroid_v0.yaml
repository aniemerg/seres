mass: 0.1
unit: kg
material_class: ceramic
notes: 'Ferrite toroid core intended for inductors. This is the toroidal core around
  which

  windings are placed to form an inductor. Material typically NiFe₂O₄ (soft ferrite)
  or

  a similar ceramic ferrite composition. Mass is a placeholder for early modeling
  and should be updated

  when coil dimensions and winding requirements are known.
