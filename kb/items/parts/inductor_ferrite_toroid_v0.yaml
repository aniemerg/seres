notes: "Ferrite toroid core intended for inductors. This is the toroidal core around\
  \ which\nwindings are placed to form an inductor. Material typically NiFe\u2082\
  O\u2084 (soft ferrite) or\na similar ceramic ferrite composition. Mass is a placeholder\
  \ for early modeling and should be updated\nwhen coil dimensions and winding requirements\
  \ are known.\n"
