id: encoder_disk_coded
kind: part
name: Coded encoder disk (intermediate)
mass: 0.15
unit: kg
material_class: metal
notes: "Intermediate product: Machined disk with Gray code or binary pattern.\n\n\
  Manufacturing stage: After precision machining, before encoder assembly.\nThis is\
  \ a pure intermediate in absolute encoder manufacturing process.\n\nPattern: Gray\
  \ code or binary absolute position encoding (magnetic or optical).\nMaterial: Aluminum\
  \ alloy with etched/machined pattern.\n\nStatus: Internal manufacturing step, not\
  \ a final product.\nUsed in: recipe_encoder_rotary_absolute_v0 (step 2 output \u2192\
  \ step 3 input)\n\nConservative Mode: Created as intermediate item to satisfy recipe\
  \ flow.\nNo standalone recipe needed (produced within encoder recipe).\n"
