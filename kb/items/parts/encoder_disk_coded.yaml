id: encoder_disk_coded
kind: part
name: Coded encoder disk (intermediate)
mass: 0.15
unit: kg
material_class: metal
notes: |
  Intermediate product: Machined disk with Gray code or binary pattern.

  Manufacturing stage: After precision machining, before encoder assembly.
  This is a pure intermediate in absolute encoder manufacturing process.

  Pattern: Gray code or binary absolute position encoding (magnetic or optical).
  Material: Aluminum alloy with etched/machined pattern.

  Status: Internal manufacturing step, not a final product.
  Used in: recipe_encoder_rotary_absolute_v0 (step 2 output → step 3 input)

  Conservative Mode: Created as intermediate item to satisfy recipe flow.
  No standalone recipe needed (produced within encoder recipe).
provenance: hand_assumption
recipe: recipe_encoder_disk_coded_v0
# Note: Typically produced as intermediate within recipe_encoder_rotary_absolute_v0,
# but standalone recipe provided for flexibility
