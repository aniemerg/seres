  Abrasive grinding wheels for precision grinding and finishing operations.

  Imported due to specialized abrasive manufacturing requirements:
  - Precision abrasive grain sizing and sorting
  - Controlled bonding agent formulation
  - High-pressure pressing (>100 MPa for vitrified wheels)
  - Controlled firing/curing (1200-1400°C for vitrified, precise thermal cycles)
  - Precision balancing and truing
  - Quality control for grain distribution and bond strength

  Typical grinding wheel composition:
  - Abrasive grains (60-90%): Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) or silicon carbide (SiC)
  - Bonding agent (10-40%): Vitrified (ceramic), resin, or rubber
  - Porosity (air spaces): 20-50% for chip clearance and cooling

  Types by abrasive:
  - Aluminum oxide (Al2O3): General purpose, steel grinding
  - Silicon carbide (SiC): Harder, for carbides and non-ferrous metals
  - Mixed grain: Custom blends for specific applications

  Types by bond:
  - Vitrified (ceramic): High temperature stability, most common
  - Resin: Organic polymer, flexible, good surface finish
  - Rubber: Very flexible, cut-off wheels

  Manufacturing steps:
  1. Grain sizing: Classify abrasive by particle size (mesh number)
  2. Mixing: Combine grains with bonding agent and additives
  3. Molding: Press into wheel shape (100-300 MPa pressure)
  4. Curing/firing: Vitrified at 1200-1400°C, resin at 150-200°C
  5. Machining: True the wheel, drill arbor hole
  6. Balancing: Ensure dynamic balance for safe high-speed operation
  7. Testing: Strength test (spin above rated RPM), grain bond verification

  Local manufacturing path (future, moderate complexity):
  - Alumina production from lunar aluminum (Hall-Heroult + calcination)
  - Silicon carbide synthesis (Si + C in arc furnace, very high temperature)
  - Vitrified bond from basalt glass frit
  - Hydraulic press for wheel forming
  - High-temperature kiln for firing
  - Precision machining for truing

  Challenges for early bootstrap:
  - Grain sizing requires classification equipment
  - Consistent bonding requires precise formulation
  - High-pressure pressing requires heavy hydraulic press
  - Firing requires controlled high-temperature kiln
  - Balancing requires precision equipment

  Applications:
  - Surface grinding, cylindrical grinding
  - Tool and die sharpening
  - Precision finishing operations
  - Cutting-off operations (thin resin-bonded wheels)

  For early bootstrapping, import high-quality grinding wheels.
