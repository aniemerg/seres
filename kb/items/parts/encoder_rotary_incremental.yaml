  Incremental rotary encoder for relative position and velocity sensing.

  Function: Tracks relative shaft rotation (requires homing/reference point).
  Technology: Incremental encoder with optical or magnetic quadrature sensing.
  Output: A/B quadrature pulses for direction and position tracking.
  Interface: Digital quadrature output (A, B channels, optional Z index).

  Simpler than absolute encoders - only tracks changes from power-on position.
  Requires homing sequence to establish absolute position reference.

  Construction:
    - Optical disk with radial pattern or magnetic ring
    - Optical sensors (LED + photodiodes) or Hall effect sensors
    - Simple signal conditioning electronics
    - Mechanical shaft coupling
    - Housing and connector

  Used in: Motor control, linear actuators, CNC machines, motion control systems.

  Conservative Mode check:
  - Similar to encoder_optical_simple_v0 (0.15kg) but more generic designation
  - Mass estimate: 0.15 kg typical for industrial incremental encoder
recipe: recipe_encoder_rotary_incremental_v0
