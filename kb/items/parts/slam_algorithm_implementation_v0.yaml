notes: "Software implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm.\n\
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0, rover autonomy\
  \ technologies\nPurpose: Enable robots to build maps while tracking their position\
  \ in unknown environments\nKey components:\n  - Sensor fusion (LIDAR, cameras, IMU,\
  \ wheel odometry)\n  - Feature extraction and matching\n  - Loop closure detection\n\
  \  - Pose graph optimization\n  - Map representation (occupancy grid or feature\
  \ map)\nAlgorithms: EKF-SLAM, FastSLAM, GraphSLAM, ORB-SLAM variants\nComputational\
  \ requirements: Real-time capable on embedded systems\nOutput: Robot pose (x, y,\
  \ \u03B8) and environmental map\nApplications: Autonomous navigation, exploration,\
  \ construction mapping\nLunar context: Critical for rover autonomy, site surveying,\
  \ construction\nSensors required: LIDAR or stereo cameras, IMU, wheel encoders\n\
  Update rate: 1-10 Hz typical for navigation\nCritical for: Autonomous rovers, construction\
  \ robots, exploration missions\n"
