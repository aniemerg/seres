  Software implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0, rover autonomy technologies
  Purpose: Enable robots to build maps while tracking their position in unknown environments
  Key components:
    - Sensor fusion (LIDAR, cameras, IMU, wheel odometry)
    - Feature extraction and matching
    - Loop closure detection
    - Pose graph optimization
    - Map representation (occupancy grid or feature map)
  Algorithms: EKF-SLAM, FastSLAM, GraphSLAM, ORB-SLAM variants
  Computational requirements: Real-time capable on embedded systems
  Output: Robot pose (x, y, θ) and environmental map
  Applications: Autonomous navigation, exploration, construction mapping
  Lunar context: Critical for rover autonomy, site surveying, construction
  Sensors required: LIDAR or stereo cameras, IMU, wheel encoders
  Update rate: 1-10 Hz typical for navigation
  Critical for: Autonomous rovers, construction robots, exploration missions
