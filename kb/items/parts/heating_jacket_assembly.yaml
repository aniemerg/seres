  Heating jacket assembly for chemical reactor vessel temperature control.
  Wraps around reactor vessel to provide uniform heating up to 1000°C.
  Components:
    - Outer jacket shell (stainless steel or carbon steel)
    - High-temperature heating elements (resistive or induction coils)
    - Thermal insulation layer (ceramic fiber or vermiculite)
    - Temperature sensor mounts (thermocouples)
    - Electrical connections and power distribution
    - Mounting brackets and support structure
  Operating range: 20-1000°C
  Heat transfer: Convective/radiative from heating elements to vessel
  Applications: Chemical reactors, molten salt systems, high-temp processing
  Power requirements: Typically 10-50 kW depending on vessel size
  Construction: Modular design for assembly around existing vessels
