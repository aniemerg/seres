notes: "Heating jacket assembly for chemical reactor vessel temperature control.\n\
  Wraps around reactor vessel to provide uniform heating up to 1000\xB0C.\nComponents:\n\
  \  - Outer jacket shell (stainless steel or carbon steel)\n  - High-temperature\
  \ heating elements (resistive or induction coils)\n  - Thermal insulation layer\
  \ (ceramic fiber or vermiculite)\n  - Temperature sensor mounts (thermocouples)\n\
  \  - Electrical connections and power distribution\n  - Mounting brackets and support\
  \ structure\nOperating range: 20-1000\xB0C\nHeat transfer: Convective/radiative\
  \ from heating elements to vessel\nApplications: Chemical reactors, molten salt\
  \ systems, high-temp processing\nPower requirements: Typically 10-50 kW depending\
  \ on vessel size\nConstruction: Modular design for assembly around existing vessels\n"
