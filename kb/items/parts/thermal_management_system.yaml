notes: "Passive thermal management system for robot motor heat dissipation.\n\nIn\
  \ vacuum-adjacent environments, convective cooling is ineffective. Heat\nmust be\
  \ conducted from motors to radiator for radiative dissipation.\n\nComponents:\n\
  - Copper heat pipes (6\xD7): Transfer heat from motors to radiator\n  - Length:\
  \ ~1m each from joint to base\n  - Diameter: 10mm\n  - Working fluid: water or ammonia\
  \ (sealed, evacuated)\n  - Mass: ~1 kg total\n- Aluminum radiator fins: Mounted\
  \ on robot base\n  - Surface area: 0.3 m\xB2\n  - Fin spacing: 10 mm\n  - Mass:\
  \ 0.8 kg\n- Thermal interface pads: Between motor housing and heat pipe\n  - Graphite\
  \ or silicone-based\n  - Mass: 0.2 kg\n\nHeat dissipation capacity: 500W continuous\
  \ (motors at 50% duty cycle).\n\nOperation: Heat conducted from motor \u2192 heat\
  \ pipe evaporates fluid \u2192 vapor\nflows to radiator \u2192 condenses, releasing\
  \ heat \u2192 radiates to environment \u2192\nliquid returns to motor end.\n\nManufacturing:\
  \ Copper and aluminum from lunar resources. Heat pipe\nfabrication requires vacuum\
  \ sealing and fluid charging (specialized).\n\nDesign reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md\
  \ section 3.7.5.\n"
