  Passive thermal management system for robot motor heat dissipation.

  In vacuum-adjacent environments, convective cooling is ineffective. Heat
  must be conducted from motors to radiator for radiative dissipation.

  Components:
  - Copper heat pipes (6×): Transfer heat from motors to radiator
    - Length: ~1m each from joint to base
    - Diameter: 10mm
    - Working fluid: water or ammonia (sealed, evacuated)
    - Mass: ~1 kg total
  - Aluminum radiator fins: Mounted on robot base
    - Surface area: 0.3 m²
    - Fin spacing: 10 mm
    - Mass: 0.8 kg
  - Thermal interface pads: Between motor housing and heat pipe
    - Graphite or silicone-based
    - Mass: 0.2 kg

  Heat dissipation capacity: 500W continuous (motors at 50% duty cycle).

  Operation: Heat conducted from motor → heat pipe evaporates fluid → vapor
  flows to radiator → condenses, releasing heat → radiates to environment →
  liquid returns to motor end.

  Manufacturing: Copper and aluminum from lunar resources. Heat pipe
  fabrication requires vacuum sealing and fluid charging (specialized).
