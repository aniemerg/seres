kind: part
name: Force/torque sensor (6-axis)
mass: 2.0
unit: kg
material_class: composite
notes: |
  6-axis force and torque sensor for robotic force control.

  Measures three force components (Fx, Fy, Fz) and three torque components
  (Tx, Ty, Tz) simultaneously.

  Specifications:
  - Force range: ±200 N per axis
  - Torque range: ±20 Nm per axis
  - Resolution: 0.1 N force, 0.01 Nm torque
  - Technology: Strain gauge bridge on machined aluminum flexure

  Mounting: Between robot wrist flange (J6) and tool adapter.

  Applications:
  - Contact detection
  - Force-controlled assembly (press fits, insertions)
  - Compliant motion
  - Tool weight compensation

  Components:
  - Machined aluminum flexure (precision geometry)
  - Strain gauges (adhesive-bonded, 4 per axis)
  - Signal conditioning electronics
  - Digital interface (SPI or analog output)

  Manufacturing: Aluminum flexure manufacturable from lunar Al. Strain gauges
  likely import (require precise resistance control). Electronics import.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.5.3.
