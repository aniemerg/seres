notes: 'Porous separator membrane for alkaline electrolyzers.

  Keeps hydrogen and oxygen gases separate during water electrolysis.


  Modern alkaline electrolyzer separators are typically made from:

  - Zirconia-polymer composites (Zirfon-type)

  - Porous ceramic matrix with polymer binder

  - Must be chemically resistant to KOH electrolyte

  - Must allow ionic conduction while preventing gas crossover


  Conservative Mode check completed:

  - Searched for: membrane, porous, separator, filter

  - Checked items: electrolyzer_cell_stack (includes separators but not as individual
  component)

  - No equivalent membrane component found

  - Created because: Essential component for water electrolysis system, used in recipe_machine_water_electrolysis_system_v0


  Mass estimate: ~150g per membrane sheet, based on typical dimensions

  (30cm x 30cm x 1-2mm) and composite density.
