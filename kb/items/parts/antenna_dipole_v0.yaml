  Half-wave dipole antenna for radio communications.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0
  Design: Two quarter-wavelength elements fed at center
  Length: λ/2 (wavelength/2) at operating frequency
  Example: 1m long for 150 MHz, 30cm for 500 MHz
  Impedance: ~73 ohms at resonance (matched to 50 or 75 ohm coax)
  Radiation pattern: Omnidirectional in plane perpendicular to antenna
  Gain: 2.15 dBi (reference dipole)
  Polarization: Linear (vertical or horizontal depending on orientation)
  Construction: Metal rods or tubes with center feed point and insulator
  Applications: Communications, telemetry, remote control, radio links
  Frequency bands: VHF, UHF, or lower depending on size
  Lunar context: Simple, reliable antenna for rover-to-base communications
  Materials: Aluminum or copper for conductivity, ceramic insulator
  Critical for: Wireless communications, telemetry, remote operation
