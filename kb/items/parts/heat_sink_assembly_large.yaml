name: Large heat sink assembly
mass: 20.0
unit: kg
material_class: aluminum
notes: "Large heat sink assembly for thermal management of high-power equipment.\n\
  Source: Referenced by various machines needing thermal management\nDesign: Extruded\
  \ or machined fins to maximize surface area\nMaterial: Aluminum for high thermal\
  \ conductivity and light weight\nSize: Large (300\xD7300\xD7100mm typical for high-power\
  \ applications)\nThermal capacity: 50-200W continuous dissipation\nMounting: Flat\
  \ base for equipment attachment, drilled for fasteners\nSurface treatment: Anodized\
  \ for corrosion resistance and emissivity\nApplications:\n  - Power electronics\
  \ (inverters, converters, motor drives)\n  - High-power vacuum tubes\n  - Laser\
  \ systems\n  - Battery thermal management\nCooling enhancement: May include heat\
  \ pipes or liquid cooling channels\nLunar context: Radiative cooling in vacuum,\
  \ large surface area needed\nCritical for: Thermal control of high-power systems,\
  \ equipment reliability\n"
