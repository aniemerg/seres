  Operating temperature: 1400-1650°C for thermionic emission

  Coating: Oxide coating (BaO, SrO, or CaO) lowers work function, increases electron
  emission

  Manufacturing: Sintered tungsten wire + oxide coating application + activation

  Status: Demonstrated in 2017 baseline hardware

  Foundation for all vacuum tube electronics (computing, communications, power control)
