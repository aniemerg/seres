kind: part
name: Coarse/fine focusing mechanism
mass: 3.0
unit: kg
material_class: steel
notes: |
  Dual coarse/fine focusing mechanism for microscopes.
  Source: Referenced by optical_microscope_v0 BOM
  Design: Rack and pinion or lead screw mechanism
  Coarse focus: Large thread pitch for rapid focusing (0.5-2mm per turn)
  Fine focus: Fine thread pitch for precise focusing (0.01-0.05mm per turn)
  Construction: Machined steel gears and screws with knobs
  Typical travel: 25-50mm coarse, calibrated fine adjustment
  Applications: Optical microscopes, measuring instruments, precision stages
  Critical features: Smooth operation, no backlash, positional stability
  Lunar context: Essential for microscopy and precision optical instruments
