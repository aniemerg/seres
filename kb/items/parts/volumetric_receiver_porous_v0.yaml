kind: part
name: Volumetric receiver with porous absorber v0
mass: 50.0
unit: kg
material_class: ceramic
notes: |
  Volumetric solar receiver with porous absorber material for air heating.
  Source: Identified from paper reviews (solar thermal systems)
  Design: Porous ceramic or metal foam absorbs concentrated sunlight
  Hot air flows through porous structure, extracting heat
  Advantages: Higher efficiency than surface receivers, uniform heating
  Materials: Porous ceramics (SiC, alumina) or metal foams
  Applications: Process heat, power generation, chemical reactions
