  Emergency stop (E-stop) safety system for industrial robotics.

  Provides immediate robot shutdown when operator pushes E-stop button.
  Required by safety standards (ISO 10218, IEC 60204-1).

  Components:
  - Emergency stop buttons (2×): Mushroom-head, red, twist-to-release
    - One on control pendant (handheld)
    - One on robot base (fixed)
    - Dual-channel contacts (redundant safety)
  - Safety relay module:
    - Dual-channel monitored circuit
    - Self-checking diagnostics
    - Forced-guided contacts (mechanically linked)
  - Wiring harness:
    - Shielded cable connecting buttons to safety relay
    - Safety relay output to motor drives (Safe Torque Off inputs)

  Operation: Pressing any E-stop button opens safety relay, which:
  1. Triggers Safe Torque Off (STO) on all 6 motor drives
  2. Removes power from motor windings
  3. Activates holding brakes (if equipped)
  4. Stops all motion immediately

  Reset: Manual twist/pull of button, then explicit reset command required.

  Manufacturing: E-stop buttons and safety relay likely import (certified
  safety components). Wiring from lunar copper.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.8.1.
