notes: |
  Inductive proximity sensor for metal object detection and workspace limiting.

  Detects ferrous or non-ferrous metal objects without physical contact using
  electromagnetic induction.

  Specifications:
  - Type: Inductive proximity switch
  - Sensing range: 0-20 mm (for steel target)
  - Target: Metal objects (ferrous or aluminum)
  - Output: Digital NPN/PNP switching output
  - Response time: <10 ms
  - Housing: M18 or M30 cylindrical, threaded
  - Protection: IP67 (dust and water proof)

  Typical use: Detecting robot position at workspace boundaries, homing
  switches, part presence detection.

  Components:
  - LC oscillator coil
  - Sensing electronics (oscillator, detector, output driver)
  - Metal housing with threaded mount

  Manufacturing: Sensing electronics import. Coil winding and housing
  potentially manufacturable from lunar copper and aluminum.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.5.4.
