kind: part
name: NiFe battery electrode set
mass: 5.0
unit: kg
material_class: composite
notes: "Set of nickel-iron (NiFe) battery electrodes - positive (nickel) and negative\
  \ (iron).\nSource: kb/seeds/battery_system_nife_v0.yaml\nPositive electrode: Nickel\
  \ hydroxide Ni(OH)2 + conductive additives + binder on steel substrate\nNegative\
  \ electrode: Iron powder Fe + additives + binder on steel substrate\nConstruction:\
  \ Active material pressed into porous steel grids or pockets\nTypical composition:\n\
  \  - Positive: 90% Ni(OH)2, 5% graphite, 5% binder\n  - Negative: 95% Fe powder,\
  \ 5% binder\nCapacity: ~0.25 Ah/g for Ni(OH)2, ~0.96 Ah/g for Fe (theoretical)\n\
  Advantages: Extremely robust, overcharge/overdischarge tolerant, long cycle life\n\
  Applications: Stationary storage, traction batteries, backup power\nLunar context:\
  \ Both Ni and Fe available from lunar materials or meteorites\nCritical for: Energy\
  \ storage, power buffering, off-sun operation\n"
