id: electrodes_nife_set
kind: part
name: NiFe battery electrode set
mass: 5.0
unit: kg
material_class: composite
notes: |
  Set of nickel-iron (NiFe) battery electrodes - positive (nickel) and negative (iron).
  Source: kb/seeds/battery_system_nife_v0.yaml
  Positive electrode: Nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 + conductive additives + binder on steel substrate
  Negative electrode: Iron powder Fe + additives + binder on steel substrate
  Construction: Active material pressed into porous steel grids or pockets
  Typical composition:
    - Positive: 90% Ni(OH)2, 5% graphite, 5% binder
    - Negative: 95% Fe powder, 5% binder
  Capacity: ~0.25 Ah/g for Ni(OH)2, ~0.96 Ah/g for Fe (theoretical)
  Advantages: Extremely robust, overcharge/overdischarge tolerant, long cycle life
  Applications: Stationary storage, traction batteries, backup power
  Lunar context: Both Ni and Fe available from lunar materials or meteorites
  Critical for: Energy storage, power buffering, off-sun operation
