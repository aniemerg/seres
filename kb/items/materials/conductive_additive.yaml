kind: material
name: Conductive additive (carbon black/graphite)
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
material_class: carbon
notes: Conductive carbon additive for battery electrodes (carbon black or fine graphite).
  Used to improve electronic conductivity in Ni-Fe electrode mixes. Now modeled with
  a local production path via the conductive_additive_production_v0 process (carbon_reductant
  -> conductive_additive).
