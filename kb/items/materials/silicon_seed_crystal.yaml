name: Silicon seed crystal
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
material_class: semiconductor
notes: 'Small single-crystal silicon rod with known crystal orientation.

  Used to initiate crystal growth in Czochralski process for single-crystal silicon
  ingots.

  Common orientations: <100> (for electronics), <111> (for some applications).

  Typical seed mass: ~1-10g (0.001-0.01 kg) per ingot pull.

  Determines crystal orientation of entire grown ingot.

  Must be dislocation-free single crystal with precise orientation.

  Critical for semiconductor wafer production.
