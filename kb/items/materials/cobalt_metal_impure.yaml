notes: "Impure cobalt metal feedstock for purification via sulfate extraction.\n\n\
  Imported because local extraction from meteorites is not yet modeled.\n\nCobalt\
  \ sources on the Moon:\n- Iron meteorites (NiFe alloys): ~0.5-1% cobalt content\
  \ (trace amounts)\n- Lunar regolith cobalt: Extremely scarce (<10 ppm, not economically\
  \ viable)\n- Meteoritic material is the only practical source\n\nLocal extraction\
  \ path (not yet modeled):\n- Meteorite processing would co-extract Co, Ni, Fe from\
  \ NiFe alloys\n- Current nickel_extraction_meteorite_v0 process only produces Ni\
  \ + Fe\n- TODO: Model cobalt co-extraction process from meteoritic material\n- Requires\
  \ multi-stage separation (similar to nickel extraction)\n- Low concentration makes\
  \ extraction challenging\n\nCurrent usage:\n- Input to cobalt_sulfate_extraction_v0\
  \ for purification\n- Produces cobalt_metal_pure (>99% purity) via roasting + electrowinning\n\
  \nApplications of purified cobalt:\n- Superalloys for high-temperature applications\n\
  - Permanent magnets (SmCo, AlNiCo)\n- Battery cathodes (LiCoO2)\n- Catalysts for\
  \ chemical synthesis\n\nConservative Mode check completed:\n- No equivalent item\
  \ found within 5\xD7 magnitude or compatible chemistry\n- Created as distinct from\
  \ cobalt_metal_pure (different purity levels)\n"
