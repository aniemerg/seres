  Impure cobalt metal feedstock for purification via sulfate extraction.

  Imported because local extraction from meteorites is not yet modeled.

  Cobalt sources on the Moon:
  - Iron meteorites (NiFe alloys): ~0.5-1% cobalt content (trace amounts)
  - Lunar regolith cobalt: Extremely scarce (<10 ppm, not economically viable)
  - Meteoritic material is the only practical source

  Local extraction path (not yet modeled):
  - Meteorite processing would co-extract Co, Ni, Fe from NiFe alloys
  - Current nickel_extraction_meteorite_v0 process only produces Ni + Fe
  - TODO: Model cobalt co-extraction process from meteoritic material
  - Requires multi-stage separation (similar to nickel extraction)
  - Low concentration makes extraction challenging

  Current usage:
  - Input to cobalt_sulfate_extraction_v0 for purification
  - Produces cobalt_metal_pure (>99% purity) via roasting + electrowinning

  Applications of purified cobalt:
  - Superalloys for high-temperature applications
  - Permanent magnets (SmCo, AlNiCo)
  - Battery cathodes (LiCoO2)
  - Catalysts for chemical synthesis

  Conservative Mode check completed:
  - No equivalent item found within 5× magnitude or compatible chemistry
  - Created as distinct from cobalt_metal_pure (different purity levels)
