  Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), white crystalline salt.
  By-product of Solvay process for sodium carbonate production.
  Can be thermally decomposed with CaO to regenerate ammonia gas.
  Reaction: 2NH4Cl + CaO → 2NH3 + CaCl2 + H2O.
  Critical for ammonia recycling in closed-loop ISRU chemistry.
  Also used in metallurgy (flux) and as nitrogen fertilizer.
  Sublimes at 340°C without melting.
