notes: "Pure lead metal for solder alloys and radiation shielding.\n\nProperties:\n\
  - Melting point: 327\xB0C\n- Density: 11,340 kg/m\xB3\n- Soft, malleable metal\n\
  \nUsed in tin-lead solder (eutectic 63/37 Sn/Pb composition).\nCan be extracted\
  \ from lunar regolith lead-bearing minerals or imported.\n\nConservative Mode: Created\
  \ as raw material input for solder production.\nTreated as import pending recipe\
  \ development for lunar extraction.\n"
