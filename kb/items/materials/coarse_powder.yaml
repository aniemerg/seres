name: Coarse powder
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
material_class: composite
notes: Coarse powder material from initial crushing or grinding operations. Particle
  size typically 0.5-5 mm. Intermediate product requiring further milling to achieve
  fine powder. Materials include metal powders (iron, aluminum, copper), ceramic powders
  (alumina, silica), mineral powders (limestone, ore concentrates), or organic powders.
  Produced by jaw crushing, hammer milling, or coarse grinding. Used as feedstock
  for ball milling, fine grinding, or direct sintering/pressing for less critical
  applications. Easier to produce than fine powders but may have lower packing density
  and sintering performance.
