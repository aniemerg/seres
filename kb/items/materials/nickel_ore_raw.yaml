  Raw nickel ore for ferrite synthesis and metal extraction.

  Nickel is scarce in lunar regolith (<100 ppm). Sources:
  - Imported from Earth (early phase)
  - Meteorite extraction (lunar surface meteorites contain ~10% Ni-Fe alloy)
  - Trade from asteroid mining operations (future)

  Common nickel ores on Earth: pentlandite ((Ni,Fe)9S8), garnierite ((Ni,Mg)3Si2O5(OH)4)

  For lunar ISRU, nickel is a critical bootstrap import for:
  - Ni-Fe batteries (Edison cells)
  - Stainless steel alloys
  - Magnetic materials (ferrites, permalloy)
  - Catalysts (hydrogenation, methanation)
