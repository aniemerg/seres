  Oxalic acid (H2C2O4) - organic dicarboxylic acid for REE precipitation.

  Imported due to complex organic synthesis requirements:
  - Requires organic chemistry capability (oxidation of carbohydrates or ethylene glycol)
  - Catalytic oxidation processes not available in early lunar base
  - Small quantities needed (5 kg per tonne of KREEP ore processed)
  - Critical for advanced REE extraction process

  Used in rare earth element (REE) extraction from KREEP basalts:
  REE³⁺ + H2C2O4 → REE2(C2O4)3 (oxalate precipitate)

  Local synthesis alternatives require:
  - Biomass/carbohydrate feedstock + oxidation catalyst
  - OR ethylene glycol (petroleum-derived) + oxidation
  - OR carbon monoxide + sodium hydroxide (industrial synthesis)

  All synthesis routes require organic chemistry infrastructure not feasible
  for early lunar base. Import justified for specialty chemical use.
