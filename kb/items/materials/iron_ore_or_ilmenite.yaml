notes: "Iron-bearing ore for metal extraction. On the Moon, primary source is ilmenite (FeTiO3) found in lunar mare basalts, typically 10-20% by mass in regolith. Also available from NiFe meteorites. On Earth includes magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), and other iron oxides. Ilmenite processed by carbothermal reduction or hydrogen reduction to yield metallic iron and titanium oxide. Lunar ilmenite abundance makes it key feedstock for in-situ iron production. Raw ore requires crushing, concentration, and reduction/smelting to extract pure iron metal."
