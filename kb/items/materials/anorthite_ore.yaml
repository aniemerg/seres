notes: "Anorthite ore (CaAl2Si2O8) from lunar highlands.\n\nAnorthite is the dominant\
  \ mineral in lunar highland crust.\nChemical formula: CaAl2Si2O8 (calcium aluminum\
  \ silicate)\nComposition by oxide: ~20% CaO, ~36% Al2O3, ~44% SiO2\n\nProperties:\n\
  - White to gray crystalline rock\n- Density: 2.76 g/cm\xB3\n- Melting point: ~1550\xB0\
  C\n- Abundant in lunar highlands (>90% of highland crust)\n\nUses in ISRU:\n- Aluminum\
  \ extraction (FFC process, carbothermal reduction)\n- Calcium extraction (for lime,\
  \ cement)\n- Silica extraction (for glass, silicon production)\n- Source for aluminosilicate\
  \ glass\n\nObtained from highland regolith beneficiation or direct mining\nof anorthosite\
  \ formations.\n\nSource: Lunar sample data, ISRU literature\n"
