  Anorthite ore (CaAl2Si2O8) from lunar highlands.

  Anorthite is the dominant mineral in lunar highland crust.
  Chemical formula: CaAl2Si2O8 (calcium aluminum silicate)
  Composition by oxide: ~20% CaO, ~36% Al2O3, ~44% SiO2

  Properties:
  - White to gray crystalline rock
  - Density: 2.76 g/cm³
  - Melting point: ~1550°C
  - Abundant in lunar highlands (>90% of highland crust)

  Uses in ISRU:
  - Aluminum extraction (FFC process, carbothermal reduction)
  - Calcium extraction (for lime, cement)
  - Silica extraction (for glass, silicon production)
  - Source for aluminosilicate glass

  Obtained from highland regolith beneficiation or direct mining
  of anorthosite formations.
