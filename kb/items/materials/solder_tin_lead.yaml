id: solder_tin_lead
name: Solder tin-lead (wire/bar)
kind: material
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
state: solid
composition: Sn 63%, Pb 37%
material_class: metal_alloy
notes: "Tin-lead solder in wire or bar form for wave soldering and hand soldering.\n\
  Standard eutectic composition (63/37 Sn/Pb) with melting point ~183\xB0C.\n\nDifferent\
  \ from solder_paste_tin_lead which is powder + flux for SMT reflow.\n\nUsed for:\n\
  - Wave soldering (molten solder bath)\n- Hand soldering with iron\n- Rework and\
  \ repair\n\nConservative Mode check:\n- solder_paste_tin_lead exists but is different\
  \ (paste form for SMT)\n- This solid form needed for wave soldering processes\n\
  - Created as distinct material\n"
