id: solder_tin_lead
name: Solder tin-lead (wire/bar)
kind: material
unit: kg
state: solid
composition: Sn 63%, Pb 37%
material_class: metal_alloy
notes: |
  Tin-lead solder in wire or bar form for wave soldering and hand soldering.
  Standard eutectic composition (63/37 Sn/Pb) with melting point ~183°C.

  Different from solder_paste_tin_lead which is powder + flux for SMT reflow.

  Used for:
  - Wave soldering (molten solder bath)
  - Hand soldering with iron
  - Rework and repair

  Conservative Mode check:
  - solder_paste_tin_lead exists but is different (paste form for SMT)
  - This solid form needed for wave soldering processes
  - Created as distinct material
