kind: material
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
material_class: chemical
notes: "Trichlorosilane (SiHCl3), liquid form.\nKey intermediate in Siemens process\
  \ for ultra-pure polysilicon production.\nProduced from metallurgical-grade silicon\
  \ and hydrogen chloride.\nReaction: Si + 3HCl \u2192 SiHCl3 + H2.\nBoiling point:\
  \ 31.8\xB0C (easily condensed from gas phase).\nHighly reactive, corrosive, flammable.\n\
  Thermally decomposes on hot silicon rods to deposit pure silicon.\nCritical for\
  \ semiconductor-grade silicon production.\n"
