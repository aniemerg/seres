  Trichlorosilane (SiHCl3), liquid form.
  Key intermediate in Siemens process for ultra-pure polysilicon production.
  Produced from metallurgical-grade silicon and hydrogen chloride.
  Reaction: Si + 3HCl → SiHCl3 + H2.
  Boiling point: 31.8°C (easily condensed from gas phase).
  Highly reactive, corrosive, flammable.
  Thermally decomposes on hot silicon rods to deposit pure silicon.
  Critical for semiconductor-grade silicon production.
