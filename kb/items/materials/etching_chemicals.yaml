notes: 'Imported specialty chemicals for PCB etching and metal surface etching.


  Common etchants include:

  - Ferric chloride (FeCl3) for copper etching

  - Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) for copper removal

  - Cupric chloride (CuCl2) for controlled etching

  - Photoresist developers and stripping solutions


  Used in PCB fabrication and chemical milling.


  Marked as import due to:

  - Complex chemical synthesis requiring purification and quality control

  - Small quantities needed (specialty chemical, not bulk material)

  - Requires chemical processing infrastructure beyond early manufacturing capability


  Future ISRU alternative: Could be synthesized from base chemicals (Fe/Cu metals
  + HCl + oxidizers)

  but requires significant chemical processing investment for minimal mass savings.
