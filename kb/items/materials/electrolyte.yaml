notes: "Electrolyte material for batteries and electrochemical processes. Types include: liquid electrolytes (sulfuric acid for lead-acid, lithium salt solutions for Li-ion), gel electrolytes (polymer-based), solid electrolytes (ceramic), or molten salts (high-temperature batteries). Enables ion transport between electrodes while preventing electron flow. Key properties: ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability window, temperature range. Used in batteries, electrolysis cells, electroplating, and fuel cells. Composition varies widely by application - examples: H2SO4 (lead-acid), LiPF6 in organic solvents (Li-ion), KOH (alkaline), molten sodium (Na-S batteries)."
