  Generic test samples used for material properties characterization.

  Samples may include:
  - Tensile test specimens
  - Compression test samples
  - Hardness test coupons
  - Thermal property samples
  - Chemical analysis specimens
  - Microstructure samples

  Typical mass: ~0.5 kg batch for comprehensive testing.

  Used in material properties testing to generate datasets
  for strength, hardness, thermal, electrical, and chemical properties.

  Imported or prepared from production materials for quality control
  and characterization testing.
