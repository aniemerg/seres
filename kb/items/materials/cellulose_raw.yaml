notes: "Raw cellulose material for chemical synthesis (e.g., CMC production).\n\n\
  Conservative Mode check:\n- Searched for: cellulose, starch, organic materials,\
  \ biomass\n- No equivalent found in KB\n- Recipe notes (recipe_binder_simple_v0)\
  \ explicitly state:\n  \"Cellulose sourced from imported organic materials or local\
  \ plant processing\"\n- Lunar context: No plant matter available, must be imported\n\
  \nSource: Import (organic feedstock)\n\nProperties: Fibrous or powdered cellulose\
  \ from plant sources\n\nPurpose: Feedstock for carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) synthesis\
  \ in battery binder production\n\nFuture alternatives: Could potentially be produced\
  \ from algae/bacterial culture\nin later phases, but initial system requires import.\n\
  \nCreated as import per Conservative Mode import termination rule.\n"
