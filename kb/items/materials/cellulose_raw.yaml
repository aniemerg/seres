id: cellulose_raw
kind: material
name: Raw cellulose
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
material_class: organic
state: solid
density: 1500  # kg/m3, typical for cellulose powder/fiber
composition: "(C6H10O5)n - polysaccharide polymer"
notes: |
  Raw cellulose material for chemical synthesis (e.g., CMC production).

  Conservative Mode check:
  - Searched for: cellulose, starch, organic materials, biomass
  - No equivalent found in KB
  - Recipe notes (recipe_binder_simple_v0) explicitly state:
    "Cellulose sourced from imported organic materials or local plant processing"
  - Lunar context: No plant matter available, must be imported

  Source: Import (organic feedstock)

  Properties: Fibrous or powdered cellulose from plant sources

  Purpose: Feedstock for carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) synthesis in battery binder production

  Future alternatives: Could potentially be produced from algae/bacterial culture
  in later phases, but initial system requires import.

  Created as import per Conservative Mode import termination rule.
