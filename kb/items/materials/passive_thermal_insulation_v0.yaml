notes: 'High-performance passive thermal insulation for cryogenic and vacuum applications.


  Imported due to advanced materials requirements:

  - Multi-layer insulation (MLI) with aluminized polyester or polyimide films

  - Aerogel or advanced foam materials with very low thermal conductivity

  - Vacuum-compatible, low outgassing materials

  - Precise layering and spacing control


  These materials require specialized polymer processing, vacuum metallization, and

  aerogel production not feasible for early lunar base. Used in cold trap modules,

  cryogenic systems, and passive thermal management.


  Local alternative: thermal_insulation_basic (ceramic fiber) for furnace/high-temp

  applications, but not suitable for cryogenic/vacuum environments.
