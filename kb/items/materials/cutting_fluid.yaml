  Coolant and lubricant for metal cutting operations. Water-based emulsions or
  oil-based cutting fluids. Provides cooling, lubrication, chip removal, and corrosion
  protection during machining. Essential for extending tool life and achieving good
  surface finishes in milling, turning, drilling, and grinding operations.
  Density set to 0.95 kg/L (typical for water-based cutting fluids) to enable L↔kg conversion.
