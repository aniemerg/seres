name: Simple binder material
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
material_class: organic
notes: 'Simple organic binder for battery electrode manufacturing.

  Source: kb/seeds/battery_system_nife_v0.yaml (NiFe battery production)

  Chemistry: Water-soluble polymer or starch-based binder

  Purpose: Hold active materials together in battery electrodes

  Typical binders: PVDF, CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose), starch, PVA (polyvinyl alcohol)

  Application: Mixed with active materials (Ni(OH)2, Fe powder) and conductive additives

  Properties: Good adhesion, electrochemically stable, processable in water or solvent

  Lunar context: Simple starch or cellulose derivatives preferred for manufacturability

  Usage: 5-15% by mass in electrode slurry

  Critical for: Battery electrode cohesion and mechanical integrity
