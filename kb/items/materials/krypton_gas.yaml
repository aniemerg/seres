id: krypton_gas
name: Krypton gas
kind: material
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
density: 3.7  # kg/m³ at STP (gas)
material_class: gas
composition:
  Kr: 1.0
notes: |
  Krypton gas (Kr) extracted from lunar regolith volatiles.

  Properties:
  - Atomic number: 36
  - Atomic mass: 83.80 amu
  - Boiling point: 119.9 K (-153°C)
  - Noble gas (chemically inert)
  - Colorless, odorless, non-flammable

  Sources on Moon:
  - Solar wind implantation in regolith
  - Concentration: ~0.02 ppm (extremely low)
  - Requires processing vast quantities of regolith

  Applications:
  - Ion engine propellant (alternative to xenon)
  - Inert atmosphere and specialized lighting
  - Leak detection tracer gas

  Production:
  - Multi-stage cryogenic distillation
  - Separation from Ar and Xe by boiling point
  - Energy intensive: ~200 kWh/kg

  Lunar context:
  - Not economical for early ISRU (extremely low concentration)
  - Recommended to import from Earth
  - Process notes: See noble_gas_extraction_v0

  Conservative Mode check completed:
  - Searched for: krypton_gas, noble gas, inert gas
  - Checked items: neon_gas, inert_gas_fill_v0
  - No equivalent found within 5x magnitude or compatible chemistry
  - Created because noble_gas_extraction_v0 explicitly outputs krypton
