kind: material
name: Machined steel part (precision)
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
material_class: steel
notes: Generic precision-machined steel part with tight tolerances and good surface
  finish. Produced by turning, milling, drilling, grinding, or multi-axis machining.
  Dimensional tolerances ±0.01-0.05 mm, surface finish Ra 0.8-3.2 μm. Used as shafts,
  bushings, gears, housings, brackets, and structural components. May require heat
  treatment for hardness. Ready for assembly into machines or further finishing operations
  (plating, coating, heat treatment). Higher quality and cost than rough machined
  parts due to precision machining requirements.
