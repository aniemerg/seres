kind: material
name: Magnesium-silicon alloy (MgSi mongrel)
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
density: 1990
material_class: alloy
composition:
  Mg: 0.634
  Si: 0.366
physical_properties:
  melting_point: 1085
  state: solid
notes: |
  Magnesium-silicon alloy produced from direct FFC reduction of olivine.
  Composition: Primarily Mg2Si intermetallic compound (~63% Mg, ~37% Si).
  Source: FFC olivine reduction - "mongrel alloy" with variable composition.
  Density: ~1.99 g/cm³ (Mg2Si intermetallic)
  Melting point: ~1085°C (Mg2Si)
  Applications:
    - Aluminum alloying additive: Mg2Si strengthens Al alloys
    - Thermoelectric materials: Mg2Si has thermoelectric properties
    - Semiconductor: Narrow-gap semiconductor
    - Hydrogen storage: Can absorb/release H2
  Properties:
    - Intermetallic compound (not mechanical mixture)
    - Improves strength, hardness, creep resistance in Al
    - Stable in vacuum (unlike pure Mg)
  Composition varies with olivine Mg/Fe ratio:
    - Pure forsterite (Mg2SiO4): ~63% Mg, ~37% Si
    - Mixed olivine: May contain Fe (MgFeSi alloy)
  Advantages: Direct one-step production from olivine
    Multiple applications (alloying, thermoelectric, H2 storage)
    More stable than pure Mg in lunar vacuum
  Disadvantages: Variable composition depending on source
    Not suitable for applications requiring pure Mg or Si
  Lunar context: Olivine in crater ejecta and maria
    Mg2Si valuable for Al alloy strengthening
    Thermoelectric potential for power generation
