mass: 1.0
unit: kg
density: 1990
material_class: alloy
composition:
  Mg: 0.634
  Si: 0.366
physical_properties:
  melting_point: 1085
  state: solid
notes: "Magnesium-silicon alloy produced from direct FFC reduction of olivine.\nComposition:\
  \ Primarily Mg2Si intermetallic compound (~63% Mg, ~37% Si).\nSource: FFC olivine\
  \ reduction - \"mongrel alloy\" with variable composition.\nDensity: ~1.99 g/cm\xB3\
  \ (Mg2Si intermetallic)\nMelting point: ~1085\xB0C (Mg2Si)\nApplications:\n  - Aluminum\
  \ alloying additive: Mg2Si strengthens Al alloys\n  - Thermoelectric materials:\
  \ Mg2Si has thermoelectric properties\n  - Semiconductor: Narrow-gap semiconductor\n\
  \  - Hydrogen storage: Can absorb/release H2\nProperties:\n  - Intermetallic compound\
  \ (not mechanical mixture)\n  - Improves strength, hardness, creep resistance in\
  \ Al\n  - Stable in vacuum (unlike pure Mg)\nComposition varies with olivine Mg/Fe\
  \ ratio:\n  - Pure forsterite (Mg2SiO4): ~63% Mg, ~37% Si\n  - Mixed olivine: May\
  \ contain Fe (MgFeSi alloy)\nAdvantages: Direct one-step production from olivine\n\
  \  Multiple applications (alloying, thermoelectric, H2 storage)\n  More stable than\
  \ pure Mg in lunar vacuum\nDisadvantages: Variable composition depending on source\n\
  \  Not suitable for applications requiring pure Mg or Si\nLunar context: Olivine\
  \ in crater ejecta and maria\n  Mg2Si valuable for Al alloy strengthening\n  Thermoelectric\
  \ potential for power generation\n"
