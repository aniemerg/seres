  after valuable minerals have been extracted. Composition varies by source ore: silicate
  rock from metal extraction, limestone from iron smelting, etc. Generally low-value
  material but may contain trace recoverable elements. Can be reprocessed for additional
  extraction, used as construction aggregate, or stored in tailings ponds. On the
  Moon, may be reprocessed for trace elements or used as regolith cover/radiation
  shielding. Byproduct of mining and metallurgical processes.'
