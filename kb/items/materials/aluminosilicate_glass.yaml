kind: material
name: Aluminosilicate glass
unit: kg
material_class: glass
composition:
  SiO2: 0.57
  Al2O3: 0.20
  MgO: 0.12
  CaO: 0.05
  FeO: 0.06
density: 2.6  # g/cm³, typical for aluminosilicate glass
notes: |
  Aluminosilicate glass produced from lunar minerals.
  Composition: 57% SiO2, 20% Al2O3, 12% MgO, 5% CaO, 6% FeO

  Properties:
  - Melting point: 1100-1350°C (lower than pure fused silica at 1710°C)
  - Density: ~2.5-2.7 g/cm³
  - Color: Greenish tint from FeO content
  - Chemical resistance: Excellent

  Applications:
  - Habitat windows and structural glazing
  - Greenhouse covers
  - Chemical-resistant containers
  - General structural glass

  Advantages over fused silica: Lower melting point saves energy, uses natural
  lunar mineral ratios close to anorthite composition.
