notes: |
  Castable refractory material for forming furnace linings and high-temperature
  structures. Consists of refractory aggregates (alumina, silica, magnesia) with
  bonding agents and water for casting. Can be poured or troweled into molds and
  shapes, then cured and fired. Used for custom furnace linings, reactor vessels,
  and complex refractory shapes where pre-formed bricks are unsuitable.

  Typical composition: 60-80% refractory aggregate, 10-20% bonding agent,
  10-20% water for workability. Density ~2300 kg/m³ when cured.

  Conservative Mode check completed:
  - Searched for: refractory_brick_set (200 kg, pre-formed, not castable)
  - Checked: chromite_refractory_v0, magnesia_refractory_v0 (different compositions)
  - No equivalent castable material found
  - Created as distinct material type (castable vs brick)
  - Density estimated from typical high-alumina castable refractories
