notes: "Castable refractory material for forming furnace linings and high-temperature\n\
  structures. Consists of refractory aggregates (alumina, silica, magnesia) with\n\
  bonding agents and water for casting. Can be poured or troweled into molds and\n\
  shapes, then cured and fired. Used for custom furnace linings, reactor vessels,\n\
  and complex refractory shapes where pre-formed bricks are unsuitable.\n\nTypical\
  \ composition: 60-80% refractory aggregate, 10-20% bonding agent,\n10-20% water\
  \ for workability. Density ~2300 kg/m\xB3 when cured.\n\nConservative Mode check\
  \ completed:\n- Searched for: refractory_brick_set (200 kg, pre-formed, not castable)\n\
  - Checked: chromite_refractory_v0, magnesia_refractory_v0 (different compositions)\n\
  - No equivalent castable material found\n- Created as distinct material type (castable\
  \ vs brick)\n- Density estimated from typical high-alumina castable refractories\n"
