notes: "Monochloroacetic acid (ClCH\u2082COOH) - chlorinated organic acid.\n\nFunction:\
  \ Reagent for carboxymethylation of cellulose (CMC synthesis).\nProperties: Crystalline\
  \ solid, melting point 63\xB0C, soluble in water.\nHazards: Corrosive, toxic - requires\
  \ careful handling.\n\nProduction routes:\n  1. Chlorination of acetic acid: CH\u2083\
  COOH + Cl\u2082 \u2192 ClCH\u2082COOH + HCl\n  2. Hydrolysis of trichloroethylene\
  \ (industrial)\n\nApplications:\n  - CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) synthesis\n \
  \ - Glycine production\n  - Herbicide intermediates\n\nLunar context: Likely import\
  \ initially; local synthesis possible from\nacetic acid + chlorine gas if needed\
  \ in large quantities.\n\nConservative Mode check completed:\n- Searched for: chloroacetic,\
  \ acetic acid, chlorinated acids\n- Checked items: chlorine_gas, various chlorides,\
  \ acids\n- No equivalent found for this specific organic synthesis reagent\n- Created\
  \ because: Required for CMC synthesis, no suitable substitute\n- Mass estimate:\
  \ Standard chemical density 1580 kg/m\xB3\n\nReferenced by: recipe_binder_simple_v0\n"
