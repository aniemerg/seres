  Monochloroacetic acid (ClCH₂COOH) - chlorinated organic acid.

  Function: Reagent for carboxymethylation of cellulose (CMC synthesis).
  Properties: Crystalline solid, melting point 63°C, soluble in water.
  Hazards: Corrosive, toxic - requires careful handling.

  Production routes:
    1. Chlorination of acetic acid: CH₃COOH + Cl₂ → ClCH₂COOH + HCl
    2. Hydrolysis of trichloroethylene (industrial)

  Applications:
    - CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) synthesis
    - Glycine production
    - Herbicide intermediates

  Lunar context: Likely import initially; local synthesis possible from
  acetic acid + chlorine gas if needed in large quantities.

  Conservative Mode check completed:
  - Searched for: chloroacetic, acetic acid, chlorinated acids
  - Checked items: chlorine_gas, various chlorides, acids
  - No equivalent found for this specific organic synthesis reagent
  - Created because: Required for CMC synthesis, no suitable substitute
  - Mass estimate: Standard chemical density 1580 kg/m³
