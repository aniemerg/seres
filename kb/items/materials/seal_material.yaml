name: Seal material (elastomeric)

unit: kg
material_class: elastomer
mass_kg_per_unit: 0.2
is_import: true
notes: 'Raw elastomeric seal material imported from Earth.


  Materials include:

  - Nitrile rubber (NBR) - oil and fuel resistance

  - EPDM - weather and chemical resistance

  - Polyurethane - abrasion resistance

  - Silicone - temperature resistance


  Used for forming O-rings, gaskets, and seals for hydraulic and pneumatic fittings.

  Typically supplied as sheet, cord, or preform ready for cutting and assembly.


  Elastomers require petrochemical feedstocks or complex synthesis, making them

  import-dependent in early lunar phases. Future: bio-synthesis or asteroid mining.
