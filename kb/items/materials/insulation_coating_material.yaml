notes: "Electrical insulation coating material for wire, components, and assemblies.\
  \ Types include: epoxy resin, polyimide (Kapton), polyurethane, acrylic, enamel,\
  \ or ceramic slurry. Applied by dipping, spraying, or powder coating followed by\
  \ curing. Provides dielectric strength (2-20 kV/mm), moisture barrier, chemical\
  \ resistance, and temperature resistance (150-400\xB0C depending on type). Used\
  \ for magnet wire insulation, transformer coatings, motor windings, and high-voltage\
  \ component protection. Typical coating thickness 0.05-0.5 mm."
