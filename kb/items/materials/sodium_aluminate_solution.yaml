  Sodium aluminate solution (NaAlO2 in water).

  Produced from anorthite via lime-soda process.
  Primary reaction: CaAl2Si2O8 + 3CaCO3 + Na2CO3 → 2NaAlO2 + products

  Properties:
  - Alkaline solution (high pH)
  - Contains dissolved sodium aluminate
  - Typical concentration: 40-50% NaAlO2

  Further processing:
  - Hydrolysis: NaAlO2 + 2H2O → NaOH + Al(OH)3
  - Calcination of Al(OH)3 → Al2O3 (alumina) at 1050°C

  Applications:
  - Intermediate for alumina production
  - Source of aluminum for aluminum metal extraction
  - Water treatment (coagulant)

  Lunar context:
  - Produced from anorthite (abundant in lunar highlands)
  - Part of complex alumina extraction route
  - Simpler carbothermal routes preferred for lunar ISRU
