kind: material
name: Thermal interface material
unit: kg
material_class: polymer
notes: Thermal grease or pad material used between electronic components and heat
  sinks to improve conduction and fill surface gaps. Typically silicone-based with
  thermally conductive fillers (e.g., alumina, zinc oxide). Modeled as a consumable
  applied in thin layers; refine density and composition later.
