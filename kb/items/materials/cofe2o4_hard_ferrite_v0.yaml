name: Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) - hard ferrite
kind: material
unit: kg
density: 5250
composition: CoFe2O4 spinel ferrite
state: solid
material_class: ceramic
notes: Seed material for permanent-magnet applications (hard ferrite). Entry seeded
  from paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0; placeholder until process routes for
  cobalt ferrite production are defined. Used as a generic hard ferrite stand-in
  for barium ferrite magnets (BaFe12O19) when a specific barium route is not modeled.
