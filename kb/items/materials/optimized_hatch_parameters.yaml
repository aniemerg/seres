notes: |
  Optimized hatch spacing and scan parameters for additive manufacturing (AM).
  Information/data product representing calibrated process parameters.

  Parameters include:
  - Hatch spacing (distance between adjacent scan lines)
  - Layer thickness
  - Scan speed
  - Laser/beam power
  - Scan pattern strategy

  Used to control overlap, density, and part quality in AM processes.
  Mass is nominal (represents data storage, ~1 MB).
