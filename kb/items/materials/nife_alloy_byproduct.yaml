unit: kg
material_class: steel
notes: Nickel-iron alloy byproduct from meteorite processing. Produced when extracting
  tungsten, nickel, or other trace elements from NiFe meteorite material. Typical
  composition 5-20% Ni, balance Fe with minor elements. Can be used as structural
  material, alloying element, or feedstock for further metal refining. Magnetic properties
  make it useful for electromagnets and magnetic shielding. Lower purity than refined
  nickel or iron but still valuable for non-critical structural applications. Lunar
  resource utilization byproduct.
