notes: |
  Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, ~98% by mass).
  Produced via contact process from SO2.

  Properties:
  - Strong acid, highly corrosive
  - Hygroscopic (absorbs water from air)
  - Exothermic when diluted (always add acid to water, not reverse)
  - Density: 1.84 g/cm³

  Uses:
  - Leaching agent for mineral processing (REE, metals)
  - Chemical synthesis feedstock
  - Can be diluted to various concentrations for specific processes

  Storage: Corrosion-resistant containers (glass, certain plastics, stainless steel)
  Safety: Highly corrosive, protective equipment required
