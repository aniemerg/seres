name: Sulfuric acid (concentrated)
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
material_class: acid
state: liquid
physical_properties:
  concentration: 0.98
  density: 1.84
  boiling_point_c: 337
notes: "Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, ~98% by mass).\nProduced via contact process\
  \ from SO2.\n\nProperties:\n- Strong acid, highly corrosive\n- Hygroscopic (absorbs\
  \ water from air)\n- Exothermic when diluted (always add acid to water, not reverse)\n\
  - Density: 1.84 g/cm\xB3\n\nUses:\n- Leaching agent for mineral processing (REE,\
  \ metals)\n- Chemical synthesis feedstock\n- Can be diluted to various concentrations\
  \ for specific processes\n\nStorage: Corrosion-resistant containers (glass, certain\
  \ plastics, stainless steel)\nSafety: Highly corrosive, protective equipment required\n"
