  Corrosion inhibitor additive for water-based metalworking fluids.

  Imported due to low consumption rate and specialty formulation requirements.

  Function: Prevents rust and corrosion of metal workpieces and machine tools
  in contact with water-based cutting fluids.

  Common corrosion inhibitor types:
  - Sodium nitrite (NaNO2): Simple inorganic inhibitor, effective for ferrous metals
  - Sodium benzoate (C7H5NaO2): Organic inhibitor, less toxic
  - Amine-based compounds: Film-forming inhibitors (e.g., ethanolamine, morpholine)
  - Phosphates/molybdates: Passivating inhibitors (e.g., Na3PO4, Na2MoO4)

  Typical usage:
  - Concentration in cutting fluids: 1-5%
  - Consumption rate: ~3% of total cutting fluid mass
  - Very low overall consumption due to fluid recycling

  Local synthesis possibility (sodium nitrite):
  - NaOH + HNO2 → NaNO2 + H2O (direct, but HNO2 is unstable)
  - OR: NaNO3 (from NaOH + HNO3) → reduce to NaNO2 (requires reducing agent)
  - Reduction methods: Pb + NaNO3 → NaNO2 + PbO (lead process, toxic)
  - OR thermal decomposition with carbon: NaNO3 + C → NaNO2 + CO (difficult to control)

  Import justification:
  - Very low mass requirement (kg quantities, not tonnes)
  - Specialty chemical formulation for optimal performance
  - Synthesis routes are complex or require toxic intermediates
  - Minimal impact on material closure (recycled with cutting fluid)
  - Cost-effective to import for early bootstrap

  Local manufacturing path (future, if needed):
  - Sodium hydroxide (NaOH): Available from chloralkali electrolysis
  - Nitric acid (HNO3): Available from Ostwald process (NH3 + O2)
  - Synthesis: Multi-step process to produce sodium nitrite
  - Quality control: Purity testing for corrosion inhibition effectiveness
