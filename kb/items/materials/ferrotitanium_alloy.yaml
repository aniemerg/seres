notes: |
  Ferrotitanium alloy produced from direct FFC reduction of ilmenite.
  "Mongrel" alloy composition (45-75% Ti typical, balance Fe).
  Properties: Moderate strength structural material.
  Used for: Non-critical structures, deoxidizing agent in metallurgy, pyrotechnic fuel.
  Caution: Oxygen-scavenging property - reacts vigorously with O2.
  Should not be used in oxidizing environments.
  Suitable for vacuum or inert atmosphere applications.
