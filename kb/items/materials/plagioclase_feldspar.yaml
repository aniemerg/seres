notes: 'Plagioclase feldspar from lunar highlands, representing mixed

  Na-Ca feldspar compositions between albite and anorthite.


  Composition range:

  - General formula: (Ca,Na)(Al,Si)4O8

  - Anorthite end-member: CaAl2Si2O8

  - Albite end-member: NaAlSi3O8


  Lunar context:

  - Dominant mineral in highland anorthosite (>90% of highland crust)

  - Often anorthite-rich but distinct from pure anorthite


  Uses in ISRU:

  - Feedstock for aluminosilicate glass and ceramics

  - Source for Al, Ca, Na, and Si extraction routes
