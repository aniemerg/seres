  Generic polymer feedstock imported from Earth for extrusion and forming.

  Includes various thermoplastics:
  - Polyethylene (PE) - general purpose
  - Polypropylene (PP) - chemical resistance
  - ABS - structural applications
  - Nylon (PA) - wear resistance
  - PTFE - high temperature, low friction
  - PEEK - aerospace grade

  Typically supplied as pellets or granules ready for extrusion.

  Polymers require petrochemical feedstocks, making them import-dependent
  in early lunar phases. Future: bio-synthesis from captured carbon,
  recycling of existing plastics, or asteroid-derived hydrocarbons.

  Used for tubing, profiles, seals, insulators, and structural components.
