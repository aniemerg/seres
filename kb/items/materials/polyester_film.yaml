notes: |
  Polyester (PET) film for magnetic tape substrate and other applications.

  Properties:
  - High tensile strength and dimensional stability
  - Chemical resistance
  - Smooth surface for coating
  - Typical thickness: 6-50 microns

  Production requires:
  - Petrochemical feedstock (ethylene glycol, terephthalic acid)
  - Polymerization reactors
  - Film extrusion and biaxial orientation equipment

  Marked as import for lunar bootstrap phase.
  Alternative: Use locally-produced films when polymer synthesis established.
