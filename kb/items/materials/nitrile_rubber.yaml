notes: |
  Nitrile rubber (NBR) for molding seals, gaskets, and flexible components.
  Synthetic rubber with excellent oil and fuel resistance.

  Properties:
  - Oil and fuel resistant
  - Good abrasion resistance
  - Temperature range: -40°C to +120°C
  - Used for O-rings, seals, gaskets, hoses

  Lunar production challenges:
  - Requires petroleum-derived monomers (butadiene, acrylonitrile)
  - Complex polymerization process
  - Alternative: Silicone rubber (can be made from lunar silicon)

  Likely import until petrochemical processing established or alternative elastomers developed.
