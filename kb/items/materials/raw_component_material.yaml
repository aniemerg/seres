  Generic raw component material imported from Earth.

  Placeholder for various raw materials used in component manufacturing
  including plastics, composites, specialty alloys, or pre-fabricated parts
  that are not yet modeled in detail.

  Used as input to placeholder manufacturing processes until specific
  material flows are defined.

  Imported during early phases; replace with locally-sourced materials
  as manufacturing capabilities expand.
