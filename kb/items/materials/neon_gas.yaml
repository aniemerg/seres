name: Neon gas
kind: material
mass: 1.0
unit: kg
density: 0.9  # kg/m³ at STP (gas)
material_class: gas
composition:
  Ne: 1.0
notes: |
  Neon gas (Ne) extracted from lunar regolith volatiles.

  Properties:
  - Atomic number: 10
  - Atomic mass: 20.18 amu
  - Boiling point: 27.1 K (-246°C)
  - Noble gas (chemically inert)
  - Colorless, odorless, non-flammable

  Sources on Moon:
  - Solar wind implantation in regolith
  - Concentration: ~0.15 ppm (extremely low)
  - Requires processing vast quantities of regolith

  Applications:
  - Cryogenic refrigerant
  - Inert atmosphere for specialized processes
  - Neon lighting (discharge tubes)
  - Leak detection tracer gas
  - Scientific instruments

  Production:
  - Multi-stage cryogenic distillation
  - Separation from Ar, Kr, Xe by boiling point
  - Energy intensive: ~200 kWh/kg

  Lunar context:
  - Not economical for early ISRU (extremely low concentration)
  - Recommended to import from Earth
  - Process notes: See noble_gas_extraction_v0
