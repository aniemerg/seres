notes: "Stub machine created during ADR 003 migration.\n\nMass updated 2026-01 from\
  \ 800 kg to 22 kg to match current incomplete BOM (24 kg steel inputs \u2192 ~22\
  \ kg after machining scrap).\n\nWARNING: This BOM is incomplete! Current BOM only\
  \ includes basic steel frame/plates. A functional pellet press requires:\n- Hydraulic\
  \ or pneumatic press mechanism\n- Motor/actuator\n- Control system\n- Die/mold set\n\
  - Feed hopper\nComplete machine would likely be 100-800 kg depending on capacity.\n"
