notes: 'Mass updated 2026-01 from 2000 kg to 1896 kg based on recipe analysis:

  Tank shell (450) + refractory lining (95) + insulation (280) + regolith media (950)

  + heat exchanger (100) + thermocouples (0.5) + piping (20) = 1895.5 kg ≈ 1896 kg.


  Thermal energy storage for solar thermal systems.

  Storage types: Sensible heat (heated rocks/regolith) or latent heat (phase change
  materials)

  Purpose: Store heat during day for nighttime or cloudy period operation

  Typical media: Regolith, basalt rock, iron oxide, or lunar minerals

  Temperature range: 600-1200°C for industrial processes

  Insulation: Regolith-based or vacuum gap insulation

  Critical for: Continuous FFC operation, 24/7 power generation'
