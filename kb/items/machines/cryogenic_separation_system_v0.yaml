name: Cryogenic separation system
mass: 800.0
unit: kg
material_class: composite
capabilities:
  - cryogenic_distillation
  - gas_separation
  - volatile_recovery
notes: |
  Cryogenic separation system for separating volatile gases at low temperatures.

  Applications:
  - Separate H2O, CO2, H2, N2, noble gases from volatile extraction
  - Fractional distillation based on boiling point differences
  - Purify gases for different uses

  System includes:
  - Cryocooler/refrigeration system (cooling to <100K)
  - Distillation column with multiple stages
  - Cold traps for condensing vapors
  - Vacuum-insulated vessels
  - Gas collection and storage

  Operating temperatures:
  - H2O: 273K (0°C)
  - CO2: 195K (-78°C)
  - N2: 77K (-196°C)
  - H2: 20K (-253°C)

  Mass estimate: 800 kg for system capable of processing 10-50 kg/day of volatiles.
