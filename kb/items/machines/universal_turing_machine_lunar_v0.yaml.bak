kind: machine
name: Universal Turing machine (lunar computing substrate) v0
mass: 50.0
unit: kg
bom: bom_universal_turing_machine_lunar_v0
material_class: composite
notes: 'Assumptions:

  - Mass aligned to assembled_equipment placeholder (50 kg) to conserve recipe mass.

  Rationale:

  - Placeholder BOM and recipe are minimal; update when detailed specs exist.

  Universal Turing machine - computing substrate for von Neumann architecture.

  Implementation options: Vacuum tube computer OR analog neural network hardware

  Purpose: Provides general-purpose computation for factory control and self-replication

  Von Neumann requirement: Universal Turing machine + Universal constructor = self-replicating

  system

  Technology choice: Vacuum tubes proven in 2017 baseline, neural networks demonstrated

  Must be capable of: Process control, scheduling, quality monitoring, self-description

  processing
