notes: "Vapor capture and condensation system for collecting water vapor from thermal\
  \ extraction processes.\n\nUsed in polar water ice extraction and other volatile\
  \ recovery operations.\n\nComponents:\n- Cold trap condenser: Chilled surface to\
  \ condense water vapor\n- Collection manifold: Piping to gather vapor from heated\
  \ regolith\n- Condensate reservoir: Tank for collected liquid water\n- Vacuum pump:\
  \ Maintain low pressure to enhance vapor collection\n- Heat exchanger: Reject condensation\
  \ heat\n\nOperating temperature: Condenser at ~0-10\xB0C, ambient pressure or slight\
  \ vacuum\n\nCapacity: Designed for kg/hr scale water extraction\n\nApplications:\n\
  - Polar ice extraction: Capture sublimed/evaporated water from heated regolith\n\
  - Thermal water extraction: Condense desorbed water from minerals\n- Volatile recovery:\
  \ Collect H2O, CO2, and other volatiles\n\nLunar context: Essential for water ISRU\
  \ at polar permanently shadowed regions\n\nMass estimate: Based on similar thermal\
  \ extraction equipment\nSource: ai_estimate, scaled from vapor_condenser_cold_trap\
