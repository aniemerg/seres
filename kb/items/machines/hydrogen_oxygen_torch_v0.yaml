notes: |
  Hydrogen-oxygen flame torch for high-temperature applications.
  Produces flame temperature ~2800°C through H2-O2 combustion.
  Primary applications:
    - Flame hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4 → SiO2 + HCl)
    - High-purity fused silica glass production
    - Chemical vapor deposition processes
  Components:
    - Gas mixing chamber with flow controls
    - Flame nozzle/burner head (refractory materials)
    - Safety interlocks and flashback arrestors
    - Pressure regulators for H2 and O2 feeds
  Operating principle:
    - 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O + heat (exothermic combustion)
    - Flame temperature regulated by H2:O2 ratio
    - Typical ratio 2:1 (stoichiometric)
  Safety features:
    - Flashback arrestors prevent flame propagation into gas lines
    - Pressure monitoring and automatic shutoff
    - Explosion-proof construction
  Used in silica_glass_high_purity_v0 process.
