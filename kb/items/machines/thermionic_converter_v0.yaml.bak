notes: "Assumptions:\n- Mass aligned to current recipe component sum (294.3 kg).\n\
  Vacuum tube-based thermionic power converter array. Converts concentrated\nsolar\
  \ thermal energy (1600-2700\xB0C) directly into electrical power via thermionic\n\
  emission. Uses CaO-coated tungsten cathodes heated to ~2000\xB0C, nickel anodes\n\
  for electron collection, and fused silica vacuum tube envelopes. Conversion efficiency:\n\
  10% primitive systems, 15-20% optimized, 30% theoretical maximum. 100% lunar-manufacturable\n\
  from anorthite and meteoritic materials. See: design/solar_thermionics_report.md\n"
