notes: |
  Vapor capture and condensation system for collecting water vapor from thermal extraction processes.

  Used in polar water ice extraction and other volatile recovery operations.

  Components:
  - Cold trap condenser: Chilled surface to condense water vapor
  - Collection manifold: Piping to gather vapor from heated regolith
  - Condensate reservoir: Tank for collected liquid water
  - Vacuum pump: Maintain low pressure to enhance vapor collection
  - Heat exchanger: Reject condensation heat

  Operating temperature: Condenser at ~0-10°C, ambient pressure or slight vacuum

  Capacity: Designed for kg/hr scale water extraction

  Applications:
  - Polar ice extraction: Capture sublimed/evaporated water from heated regolith
  - Thermal water extraction: Condense desorbed water from minerals
  - Volatile recovery: Collect H2O, CO2, and other volatiles

  Lunar context: Essential for water ISRU at polar permanently shadowed regions

  Mass estimate: Based on similar thermal extraction equipment
