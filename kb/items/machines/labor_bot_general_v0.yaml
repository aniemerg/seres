  6-DOF industrial robotic manipulator for lunar manufacturing operations.

  Design specification: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md

  Key specifications:
  - Configuration: 6R serial manipulator (6 revolute joints)
  - Reach: 2.0 m workspace radius
  - Payload: 20 kg at full extension
  - Repeatability: ±0.5 mm
  - Degrees of freedom: 6 (full 3D position + orientation)
  - End effector: Electric parallel gripper with quick-change interface

  Architecture:
  - Mechanical structure: Aluminum/steel links and housings (35 kg)
  - Actuation: 6× brushless DC motors with harmonic drive reducers (30 kg)
  - Power system: 48V DC from 240V 3-phase AC supply (8 kg)
  - Control: Industrial PC with real-time Linux, 6× servo drives (6 kg)
  - Sensing: Stereo cameras, 6-axis force sensor, encoders (12 kg)
  - Integration: Cables, thermal management, safety systems (21 kg)

  Lunar manufacturability:
  - Structures, cables, thermal: ~46% (lunar Al/Fe/Cu)
  - Motors, gearboxes: ~29% (need magnets, precision)
  - Electronics, sensors: ~25% (Earth import)

  Assembly time: ~140 hours with all parts available
  Power consumption: 825W average, 2.7kW peak
  Service life: 10,000 hours before major overhaul

  Operates inside pressurized habitat (not EVA-rated). Provides versatile
  manipulation for assembly, material handling, quality inspection, and
  machine operation tasks.
