notes: Vacuum chamber for processing materials and components under vacuum conditions.
  Sealed stainless steel or aluminum vessel with vacuum pumps, pressure gauges, and
  access ports. Achieves vacuum levels from rough vacuum (1-100 mbar) to high vacuum
  (10^-6 mbar) depending on pump configuration. Includes feedthroughs for electrical
  connections, gas inlet, and material handling. Used for vacuum tube assembly, thin
  film deposition, degassing, freeze drying, and materials testing. Chamber volume
  typically 10-100 liters. Critical for thermionic vacuum tube manufacturing.
