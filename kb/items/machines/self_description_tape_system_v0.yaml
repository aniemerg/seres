notes: "Physical storage system for von Neumann self-description.\nSource: docs/paper_reviews/photolithoautotroph_missing_tech.md,\
  \ von Neumann architecture\nPurpose: Store complete blueprints and instructions\
  \ for self-replication\nImplementation options:\n  - Magnetic tape storage (proven\
  \ technology)\n  - Punched tape (mechanical readability)\n  - Magnetic drum storage\n\
  \  - Core memory banks\nVon Neumann requirement: Universal constructor must read\
  \ self-description to replicate\nMust store: All item specs, process definitions,\
  \ machine designs, control programs\nCapacity: ~10-100 MB estimated for complete\
  \ factory description\nRedundancy: Multiple copies for reliability\nRead/write:\
  \ Magnetic or mechanical read/write heads\nCritical for: Self-replication capability,\
  \ bootstrap from minimal seed\n\nMass updated from 100 kg to 60 kg to match BOM\
  \ component total (56.5 kg) plus fasteners (3.5 kg).\n"
