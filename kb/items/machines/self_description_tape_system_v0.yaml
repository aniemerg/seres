  Physical storage system for von Neumann self-description.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/photolithoautotroph_missing_tech.md, von Neumann architecture
  Purpose: Store complete blueprints and instructions for self-replication
  Implementation options:
    - Magnetic tape storage (proven technology)
    - Punched tape (mechanical readability)
    - Magnetic drum storage
    - Core memory banks
  Von Neumann requirement: Universal constructor must read self-description to replicate
  Must store: All item specs, process definitions, machine designs, control programs
  Capacity: ~10-100 MB estimated for complete factory description
  Redundancy: Multiple copies for reliability
  Read/write: Magnetic or mechanical read/write heads
  Critical for: Self-replication capability, bootstrap from minimal seed
