notes: |
  Industrial Hall-Héroult electrolysis cell for aluminum production.

  Operating conditions:
  - Temperature: ~960°C (molten cryolite bath)
  - Electrolyte: Cryolite (Na3AlF6) with dissolved alumina (Al2O3)
  - Electrodes: Carbon anodes (consumable), molten aluminum cathode
  - Power consumption: ~15 kWh per kg aluminum produced

  The cell consists of:
  - Steel shell with refractory lining (carbon and alumina)
  - Carbon anode blocks (replaced as consumed)
  - Molten cryolite bath
  - Aluminum collection system
  - Thermal management (highly exothermic)

  Mass estimate based on small-scale lunar ISRU cell (much smaller than
  industrial Earth cells which can be 20+ tonnes). Suitable for producing
  100-500 kg aluminum per day.

  Provides the 'electrolysis_cell_aluminum' resource capacity for aluminum
  smelting processes.
