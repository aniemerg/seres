kind: machine
name: Hydrogen-oxygen torch
mass: 15.0
unit: kg
material_class: steel
bom: bom_hydrogen_oxygen_torch_v0
capabilities:
- flame_hydrolysis
- high_temp_heating
notes: "Hydrogen-oxygen flame torch for high-temperature applications.\nProduces flame\
  \ temperature ~2800\xB0C through H2-O2 combustion.\nPrimary applications:\n  - Flame\
  \ hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4 \u2192 SiO2 + HCl)\n  - High-purity\
  \ fused silica glass production\n  - Chemical vapor deposition processes\nComponents:\n\
  \  - Gas mixing chamber with flow controls\n  - Flame nozzle/burner head (refractory\
  \ materials)\n  - Safety interlocks and flashback arrestors\n  - Pressure regulators\
  \ for H2 and O2 feeds\nOperating principle:\n  - 2H2 + O2 \u2192 2H2O + heat (exothermic\
  \ combustion)\n  - Flame temperature regulated by H2:O2 ratio\n  - Typical ratio\
  \ 2:1 (stoichiometric)\nSafety features:\n  - Flashback arrestors prevent flame\
  \ propagation into gas lines\n  - Pressure monitoring and automatic shutoff\n  -\
  \ Explosion-proof construction\nUsed in silica_glass_high_purity_v0 process.\n"
