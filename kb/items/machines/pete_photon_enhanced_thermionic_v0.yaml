  generation

  Principle: Photons heat cathode and excite electrons, which emit thermionically

  Combines photovoltaic excitation with thermionic emission

  Cathode: Low work function material (cesium-coated, diamond, or specialized semiconductors)

  Anode: Collector electrode at lower temperature

  Vacuum gap: Electrons traverse vacuum space

  Theoretical efficiency: 40-50% (combines photo-excitation with thermal emission)

  Operating temperature: 600-1000°C at cathode

  Advantages: Higher efficiency than pure thermionic, simpler than hybrid PV-thermal

  Challenges: Maintaining low work function, space charge effects, thermal management

  Lunar context: Concentrated sunlight provides both photons and heat

  Development status: Experimental, demonstrated in labs

  Critical for: High-efficiency solar power, future power generation systems
