notes: "PETE (Photon Enhanced Thermionic Emission) solar energy converter.\nSource:\
  \ docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0, thermionic power generation\n\
  Principle: Photons heat cathode and excite electrons, which emit thermionically\n\
  Combines photovoltaic excitation with thermionic emission\nCathode: Low work function\
  \ material (cesium-coated, diamond, or specialized semiconductors)\nAnode: Collector\
  \ electrode at lower temperature\nVacuum gap: Electrons traverse vacuum space\n\
  Theoretical efficiency: 40-50% (combines photo-excitation with thermal emission)\n\
  Operating temperature: 600-1000\xB0C at cathode\nAdvantages: Higher efficiency than\
  \ pure thermionic, simpler than hybrid PV-thermal\nChallenges: Maintaining low work\
  \ function, space charge effects, thermal management\nLunar context: Concentrated\
  \ sunlight provides both photons and heat\nDevelopment status: Experimental, demonstrated\
  \ in labs\nCritical for: High-efficiency solar power, future power generation systems\n"
