notes: |
  Stepper motor for precise positioning without feedback.
  Source: Referenced by various positioning systems (XY tables, threading machines, etc.)
  Principle: Electromagnetic coils energized in sequence rotate rotor in discrete steps
  Step angle: 0.9°, 1.8°, or 3.6° typical (400, 200, or 100 steps/rev)
  Types: Permanent magnet, variable reluctance, hybrid
  Torque: Holding torque higher than running torque
  Control: Requires stepper driver with step/direction signals
  Advantages: Open-loop positioning, no encoder needed, holds position at rest
  Disadvantages: Can lose steps under overload, resonance at certain speeds
  Applications: 3D printers, CNC machines, robotics, precision stages
  Microstepping: Driver technique for smoother motion and higher resolution
  Typical size: NEMA 17 (42mm) or NEMA 23 (57mm)
  Lunar context: Reliable positioning without complex feedback systems
  Critical for: Precision motion control, automated machinery
