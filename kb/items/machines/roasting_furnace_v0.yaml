unit: kg
material_class: refractory
notes: |
  Pyrometallurgical roasting furnace for oxidizing sulfide ores.
  Operating temperature: 600-900°C
  Process: Oxidation of metal sulfides to oxides + SO2 gas

  Applications:
    - Troilite (FeS) roasting: 4FeS + 7O2 → 2Fe2O3 + 4SO2
    - Cobalt sulfide roasting
    - Sulfide ore preprocessing

  Components:
    - Refractory-lined chamber with rotating drum or fluidized bed
    - Air/oxygen injection system for controlled oxidation
    - Gas collection manifold for SO2 capture
    - Temperature control and monitoring
    - Heating elements (electric resistance or burners)
    - Insulation to maintain temperature

  Gas handling: SO2 must be captured for:
    - Claus process (sulfur recovery)
    - Sulfuric acid production
    - Environmental containment

  Construction: Refractory brick lining, steel shell, insulation
  Fuel: Electric resistance or solar-thermal heating

  Critical for lunar sulfur chemistry and metal extraction from meteorites.
