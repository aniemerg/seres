  Automated or semi-automated machine for threading magnetic core memory.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/papers_gap_seed_v0 (computing hardware)
  Technology: Magnetic core memory - ferrite toroids threaded with wires
  Process: X, Y, Z sense/inhibit wires threaded through matrix of cores
  Grid: Cores arranged in N×N grid, each core = 1 bit storage
  Threading: Precise wire routing through each core (X, Y, sense, inhibit wires)
  Challenges: Extremely tedious manual process, automation highly desirable
  Typical production: 4096-bit core plane (64×64 cores) takes hours manually
  Automation: XY positioning table with wire threading needle mechanism
  Quality: Visual inspection, continuity testing, read/write verification
  Applications: Non-volatile memory for computing systems (1950s-1970s tech)
  Lunar context: Proven technology, radiation-hard, manufacturable with local materials
  Critical for: Computer memory in vacuum tube computing systems
