notes: "Automated or semi-automated machine for threading magnetic core memory.\n\
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/papers_gap_seed_v0 (computing hardware)\nTechnology:\
  \ Magnetic core memory - ferrite toroids threaded with wires\nProcess: X, Y, Z sense/inhibit\
  \ wires threaded through matrix of cores\nGrid: Cores arranged in N\xD7N grid, each\
  \ core = 1 bit storage\nThreading: Precise wire routing through each core (X, Y,\
  \ sense, inhibit wires)\nChallenges: Extremely tedious manual process, automation\
  \ highly desirable\nTypical production: 4096-bit core plane (64\xD764 cores) takes\
  \ hours manually\nAutomation: XY positioning table with wire threading needle mechanism\n\
  Quality: Visual inspection, continuity testing, read/write verification\nApplications:\
  \ Non-volatile memory for computing systems (1950s-1970s tech)\nLunar context: Proven\
  \ technology, radiation-hard, manufacturable with local materials\nCritical for:\
  \ Computer memory in vacuum tube computing systems\n"
