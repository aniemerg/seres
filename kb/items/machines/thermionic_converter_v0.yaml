material_class: composite
notes: "Vacuum tube-based thermionic power converter array. Converts concentrated solar thermal energy (1600-2700°C) directly into electrical power via thermionic emission. Uses CaO-coated tungsten cathodes heated to ~2000°C, nickel anodes for electron collection, and fused silica vacuum tube envelopes. Conversion efficiency: 10% primitive systems, 15-20% optimized, 30% theoretical maximum. 100% lunar-manufacturable from anorthite and meteoritic materials. See: design/solar_thermionics_report.md"
