notes: 'Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) machine. Deposits metal from continuous
  welding wire using arc welding, suitable for rapid metallic part fabrication on
  lunar surfaces.


  Mass is an estimate based on large WAAM frames; actual mass may vary with configuration.
  Assumed to be a fixed-capacity fabricator with onboard drive & positioning.


  Marked as import 2026-01: Currently no local manufacturing capability. Import-only
  until BOM v1 is refined and local production recipe developed. See recipe_wire_arc_additive_machine_v2
