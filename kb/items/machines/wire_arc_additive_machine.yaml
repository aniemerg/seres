notes: |
  Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) machine. Deposits metal from a continuous welding wire
  using arc welding, suitable for rapid metallic part fabrication on lunar surfaces. Mass is an
  estimate based on large WAAM frames; actual mass may vary with configuration. Assumed to be a
  fixed-capacity fabricator with onboard drive & positioning. This entry resolves the gap for
  referenced machine used in seeds/recipes; further operational parameters will be refined as more
  data becomes available.
