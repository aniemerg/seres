name: HelioStat array system v0
mass: 885.0
unit: kg
bom: bom_heliostat_array_system_v0_v0
notes: 'Assumptions:

  - Mass aligned to current BOM component sum (885 kg).

  Rationale:

  - Avoids mass imbalance in recipe assembly step; placeholder until full field scaling.

  Central heliostat array system placeholder entry referenced by seed file.

  Represents a generic heliostat field configured to direct solar energy to a receiver.

  Mass and capabilities are coarse estimates for modeling; detailed subcomponents

  (mirrors, actuators, control systems) are modeled as separate items when defined.
