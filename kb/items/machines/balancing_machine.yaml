notes: 'Precision balancing machine for rotating assemblies. Includes drive motors,

  vibration sensors, and measurement electronics. Handles both precision balancing

  operations and heavier tasks like roll balancing for rolling mills.


  Conservative Mode consolidation: Replaces former dynamic_balancing_stand_v0

  (70kg placeholder). Mass difference (450kg vs 70kg) acceptable within equivalence

  guidelines - both perform dynamic balancing, this machine has proper instrumentation.
