notes: "Hydraulic press for compacting lunar regolith into construction bricks.\n\
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0\nProcess: High\
  \ pressure compaction of regolith, optionally with binder\nPressure: 10-100 MPa\
  \ typical for adequate brick strength\nBrick size: Variable molds (e.g., 200×100×50mm\
  \ standard brick)\nCycle time: 1-5 minutes per brick depending on pressure and curing\n\
  Sintering: May be followed by solar or furnace sintering for higher strength\nApplications:\n\
  \  - Radiation shielding walls\n  - Habitat construction\n  - Landing pad construction\n\
  \  - Road construction\nAdvantages: Uses abundant local regolith, simple process,\
  \ low energy\nBrick properties: Compressive strength 5-50 MPa depending on processing\n\
  Lunar context: Essential for in-situ construction and infrastructure\nCritical for:\
  \ Shelter, radiation protection, infrastructure development\n"
