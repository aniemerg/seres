notes: "Hydraulic press for compacting lunar regolith into construction bricks.\n\
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0\nProcess: High\
  \ pressure compaction of regolith, optionally with binder\nPressure: 10-100 MPa\
  \ typical for adequate brick strength\nBrick size: Variable molds (e.g., 200\xD7\
  100\xD750mm standard brick)\nCycle time: 1-5 minutes per brick depending on pressure\
  \ and curing\nSintering: May be followed by solar or furnace sintering for higher\
  \ strength\nApplications:\n  - Radiation shielding walls\n  - Habitat construction\n\
  \  - Landing pad construction\n  - Road construction\nAdvantages: Uses abundant\
  \ local regolith, simple process, low energy\nBrick properties: Compressive strength\
  \ 5-50 MPa depending on processing\nLunar context: Essential for in-situ construction\
  \ and infrastructure\nCritical for: Shelter, radiation protection, infrastructure\
  \ development\n"
