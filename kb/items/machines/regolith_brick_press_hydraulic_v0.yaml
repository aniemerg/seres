  Hydraulic press for compacting lunar regolith into construction bricks.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0
  Process: High pressure compaction of regolith, optionally with binder
  Pressure: 10-100 MPa typical for adequate brick strength
  Brick size: Variable molds (e.g., 200×100×50mm standard brick)
  Cycle time: 1-5 minutes per brick depending on pressure and curing
  Sintering: May be followed by solar or furnace sintering for higher strength
  Applications:
    - Radiation shielding walls
    - Habitat construction
    - Landing pad construction
    - Road construction
  Advantages: Uses abundant local regolith, simple process, low energy
  Brick properties: Compressive strength 5-50 MPa depending on processing
  Lunar context: Essential for in-situ construction and infrastructure
  Critical for: Shelter, radiation protection, infrastructure development
