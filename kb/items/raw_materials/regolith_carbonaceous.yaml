description: |
  Carbonaceous chondrite material from meteorite impacts. Rich in carbon (2-5%),
  volatiles, and organic compounds. Valuable for ISRU carbon extraction.

composition:
  C: 0.03
  H2O: 0.10
  SiO2: 0.35
  FeO: 0.25
  MgO: 0.15
  other: 0.12

physical_properties:
  bulk_density_kg_per_m3: 1400
  particle_size_mean_microns: 60
  notes: Carbonaceous material from CM/CI chondrite impacts

notes: |
  Carbonaceous regolith from meteorite impact sites. Less abundant than
  silicate regolith (~1-2% of surface), but critical source of carbon and
  volatiles for ISRU operations.
