description: |
  Ice-bearing regolith from permanently shadowed craters (PSCs) at lunar poles.

  Contains significant water ice deposits (5.6% ± 2.9% by mass) mixed with
  silicate regolith. Ice is rock-hard at PSC temperatures (~40 K / -233°C).

  When ice-cemented, this material is extremely hard (similar to concrete)
  and requires specialized drilling equipment for excavation.

composition:
  H2O_ice: 0.056
  SiO2: 0.42
  Al2O3: 0.10
  FeO: 0.08
  CaO: 0.10
  MgO: 0.06
  TiO2: 0.04
  other: 0.126

physical_properties:
  bulk_density_kg_per_m3: 1700
  particle_size_mean_microns: 70
  temperature_K: 40
  notes: |
    Ice-cemented regolith in PSCs. Extremely hard when frozen.
    Composition (excluding ice) similar to mixed highlands/mare regolith.
    Density higher than dry regolith due to ice cement filling pores.

  Permanently shadowed crater (PSC) regolith from lunar poles.

  Source: LCROSS impact data (Cabeus crater, south pole)
  Water ice concentration: 5.6% by mass (range: 2.7% - 8.5%)
  Temperature: ~40 K (-233°C) in permanent shadow

  Location characteristics:
  - North and south pole PSCs
  - Total PSC area: >31,000 km² (both poles)
  - Estimated ice inventory: 3-6 × 10¹² kg (3-6 billion tonnes)
  - Cabeus crater: High concentration region
  - 40+ craters at north pole with ice potential

  Physical properties:
  - Ice-cemented when frozen (rock-hard, similar to drilling concrete)
  - Subsurface ice insulated by dry regolith overburden
  - May be in layers or pockets (not uniformly distributed)
  - Ice characteristics depend on depth and local geology

  Operational challenges:
  - Extreme cold (40 K requires special equipment)
  - Permanently dark (no direct sunlight, requires heliostats or nuclear power)
  - Rugged terrain (South Pole-Aitken basin: 11 km elevation changes)
  - Hard drilling (ice-cemented material)

  Compositional notes:
  - Base regolith composition (excluding ice) assumed mixed highlands/mare
  - PSCs can occur in both highland and mare regions
  - Actual composition varies by specific PSC location
  - 5.6% is average concentration; range 2.7% - 8.5% observed
