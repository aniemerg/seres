description: "Ice-bearing regolith from permanently shadowed craters (PSCs) at lunar\
  \ poles.\n\nContains significant water ice deposits (5.6% \xB1 2.9% by mass) mixed\
  \ with\nsilicate regolith. Ice is rock-hard at PSC temperatures (~40 K / -233\xB0\
  C).\n\nWhen ice-cemented, this material is extremely hard (similar to concrete)\n\
  and requires specialized drilling equipment for excavation.\n"

  temperature_K: 40
  notes: 'Ice-cemented regolith in PSCs. Extremely hard when frozen.

    Composition (excluding ice) similar to mixed highlands/mare regolith.

    Density higher than dry regolith due to ice cement filling pores.

notes: "Permanently shadowed crater (PSC) regolith from lunar poles.\n\nSource: LCROSS\
  \ impact data (Cabeus crater, south pole)\nWater ice concentration: 5.6% by mass\
  \ (range: 2.7% - 8.5%)\nTemperature: ~40 K (-233\xB0C) in permanent shadow\n\nLocation\
  \ characteristics:\n- North and south pole PSCs\n- Total PSC area: >31,000 km\xB2\
  \ (both poles)\n- Estimated ice inventory: 3-6 \xD7 10\xB9\xB2 kg (3-6 billion tonnes)\n\
  - Cabeus crater: High concentration region\n- 40+ craters at north pole with ice\
  \ potential\n\nPhysical properties:\n- Ice-cemented when frozen (rock-hard, similar\
  \ to drilling concrete)\n- Subsurface ice insulated by dry regolith overburden\n\
  - May be in layers or pockets (not uniformly distributed)\n- Ice characteristics\
  \ depend on depth and local geology\n\nOperational challenges:\n- Extreme cold (40\
  \ K requires special equipment)\n- Permanently dark (no direct sunlight, requires\
  \ heliostats or nuclear power)\n- Rugged terrain (South Pole-Aitken basin: 11 km\
  \ elevation changes)\n- Hard drilling (ice-cemented material)\n\nCompositional notes:\n\
  - Base regolith composition (excluding ice) assumed mixed highlands/mare\n- PSCs\
  \ can occur in both highland and mare regions\n- Actual composition varies by specific\
  \ PSC location\n- 5.6% is average concentration; range 2.7% - 8.5% observed\n"
