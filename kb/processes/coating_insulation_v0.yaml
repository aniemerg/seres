notes: "Application of electrical insulation coating to parts, wires, or components. Methods include dip coating, spray coating, or powder coating with epoxy, polyimide, ceramic, or enamel materials. Followed by curing/drying in oven. Provides electrical insulation (dielectric strength), moisture barrier, and corrosion protection. Used for magnet wires, electrical components, motor windings, and high-voltage parts. Coating thickness typically 0.05-0.5 mm."
