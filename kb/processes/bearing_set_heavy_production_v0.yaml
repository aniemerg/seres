  Complete ball bearing set production process for heavy machinery. Produces one set of
  heavy-duty ball bearings suitable for high-load applications.

  Process steps:
  1. **Forging**: Upset forging to create inner and outer race ring blanks from bar stock
  2. **Rough machining**: Turn races to near-final dimensions on lathe (raceways, shoulders, bore, OD)
  3. **Heat treatment**:
     - Carburize or through-harden to HRC 58-62
     - Quench in oil
     - Temper at 150-200°C for dimensional stability and toughness
  4. **Precision grinding**: Grind raceways to final tolerances (±0.005mm) and surface finish (Ra 0.2μm)
  5. **Ball production**:
     - Cast or forge ball blanks
     - Rough grind to near-spherical
     - Heat treat to HRC 60-65
     - Precision lap/grind for sphericity and surface finish
  6. **Cage fabrication**: Stamp or machine cage from steel sheet/bar
  7. **Assembly**: Install balls in races with cage, pack with grease, seal
  8. **Inspection**: Check running torque, radial play, and smoothness

  Typical bearing specifications for "heavy" set (updated to realistic 4kg total):
  - Bore: 70-100mm (size 6314-6320)
  - OD: 130-180mm
  - Width: 30-40mm
  - Load rating: 100-200 kN dynamic
  - ~12-16 balls per bearing
  - Mass: ~2 kg per bearing
  - Set includes: 2 bearings (one at each end of shaft)

  Critical quality requirements:
  - Hardness: HRC 58-65 for races and balls (wear resistance)
  - Surface finish: Ra 0.1-0.4 μm (low friction, long life)
  - Dimensional tolerance: ISO P6 or better (smooth running)
  - Residual stress: Properly tempered (prevent cracking)

  Material: High-carbon steel (0.95-1.10% C) or bearing steel equivalent (SAE 52100)

  This is a simplified integrated process. In practice, bearing manufacturing is highly
  specialized with dedicated machinery for each operation.
