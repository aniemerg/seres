notes: "Complete ball bearing set production process for heavy machinery. Produces\
  \ one set of\nheavy-duty ball bearings suitable for high-load applications.\n\n\
  Process steps:\n1. **Forging**: Upset forging to create inner and outer race ring\
  \ blanks from bar stock\n2. **Rough machining**: Turn races to near-final dimensions\
  \ on lathe (raceways, shoulders, bore, OD)\n3. **Heat treatment**:\n   - Carburize\
  \ or through-harden to HRC 58-62\n   - Quench in oil\n   - Temper at 150-200°C for\
  \ dimensional stability and toughness\n4. **Precision grinding**: Grind raceways\
  \ to final tolerances (±0.005mm) and surface finish (Ra 0.2μm)\n5. **Ball production**:\n\
  \   - Cast or forge ball blanks\n   - Rough grind to near-spherical\n   - Heat treat\
  \ to HRC 60-65\n   - Precision lap/grind for sphericity and surface finish\n6. **Cage\
  \ fabrication**: Stamp or machine cage from steel sheet/bar\n7. **Assembly**: Install\
  \ balls in races with cage, pack with grease, seal\n8. **Inspection**: Check running\
  \ torque, radial play, and smoothness\n\nTypical bearing specifications for \"heavy\"\
  \ set (updated to realistic 4kg total):\n- Bore: 70-100mm (size 6314-6320)\n- OD:\
  \ 130-180mm\n- Width: 30-40mm\n- Load rating: 100-200 kN dynamic\n- ~12-16 balls\
  \ per bearing\n- Mass: ~2 kg per bearing\n- Set includes: 2 bearings (one at each\
  \ end of shaft)\n\nCritical quality requirements:\n- Hardness: HRC 58-65 for races\
  \ and balls (wear resistance)\n- Surface finish: Ra 0.1-0.4 μm (low friction, long\
  \ life)\n- Dimensional tolerance: ISO P6 or better (smooth running)\n- Residual\
  \ stress: Properly tempered (prevent cracking)\n\nMaterial: High-carbon steel (0.95-1.10%\
  \ C) or bearing steel equivalent (SAE 52100)\n\nThis is a simplified integrated\
  \ process. In practice, bearing manufacturing is highly\nspecialized with dedicated\
  \ machinery for each operation.\n"
