  hr_per_kg: 6.0
  notes: gradual heating, soak at peak temperature, controlled cooling to prevent thermal shock
notes: High-temperature kiln firing process for ceramic and refractory materials. Brings parts to final hardness, strength,
  and temperature resistance through controlled heating and cooling cycles.
