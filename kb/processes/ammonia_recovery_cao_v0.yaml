  Ammonia recovery from ammonium chloride using calcium oxide (Solvay process recycling).
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt
  Reaction: 2NH4Cl + CaO → 2NH3 + CaCl2 + H2O
  Temperature: Moderate heating (200-400°C)
  Purpose: Regenerate ammonia from Solvay process by-product for reuse in Haber-Bosch
  Produces CaCl2 which replenishes FFC Cambridge electrolyte
  Process details:
    1. Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) from Solvay process by-product
    2. Calcium oxide (CaO, quicklime) from anorthite or limestone
    3. Mix NH4Cl and CaO in rotary kiln or reactor
    4. Heat to 200-400°C
    5. NH4Cl + CaO → NH3 (gas) + CaCl2 + H2O
    6. Ammonia gas driven off by heat
    7. Capture NH3 gas via condensation or absorption
    8. Calcium chloride and water remain as solid/liquid
    9. Dry CaCl2 for use as FFC electrolyte
  Products:
    - Ammonia gas (NH3): 63.6% by mass (recycled to Haber-Bosch)
    - Calcium chloride (CaCl2): Anhydrous form, 207.5% by mass of NH4Cl input
    - Water vapor: 33.8% by mass
  Stoichiometry: 2NH4Cl (107g) + CaO (56.1g) → 2NH3 (34g) + CaCl2 (111g) + H2O (18g)
  Per kg NH4Cl: 0.636 kg NH3, 2.075 kg CaCl2 (includes CaO input mass), 0.338 kg H2O
  Note: CaCl2 mass includes both Cl from NH4Cl and Ca from CaO
  Reaction characteristics:
    - Exothermic when CaO hydrates
    - NH3 release endothermic (requires heating)
    - Net: Slightly exothermic overall
  Solvay process integration:
    - Solvay: NaCl + NH3 + CO2 → NaHCO3 + NH4Cl
    - This process: NH4Cl + CaO → NH3 (recycled) + CaCl2
    - Overall: 97-98% NH3 recovery efficiency
    - NH3 is recycling reagent, not consumed
  CaCl2 uses:
    - FFC Cambridge electrolyte: Primary use
    - Desiccant: Moisture absorption
    - De-icing: Road treatment (Earth applications)
    - Can be recycled to CaO + HCl if needed
  Advantages: Recovers valuable NH3 for recycling
    Converts waste NH4Cl to useful CaCl2
    Replenishes FFC electrolyte stock
    Simple thermal process, no exotic reagents
    High recovery efficiency (>95%)
  Disadvantages: Requires CaO input (consumable)
    Produces water that may need separation
    Moderate energy for heating
  Lunar context: Critical for nitrogen conservation
    Nitrogen extremely scarce on Moon (ppb in volatiles)
    Must recycle NH3 with high efficiency
    Ammonia used in multiple processes:
      - Haber-Bosch (regenerates N2 → NH3)
      - Solvay process (Na2CO3 production)
      - Ostwald process (HNO3 production)
    CaCl2 by-product valuable for FFC electrolyte
  Alternative ammonia recovery:
    - NH4Cl → NH3 + HCl (direct thermal decomposition)
    - Requires higher temperature (338°C sublimation)
    - Produces HCl which can be useful separately
    - CaO route preferred when CaCl2 is desired
  Process optimization:
    - Use excess CaO to ensure complete NH3 liberation
    - Capture NH3 in water (aqueous ammonia solution)
    - Or cryogenic condensation (liquid NH3 at -33°C)
    - Dry CaCl2 thoroughly (hygroscopic, absorbs moisture)
  Calcium oxide sources (lunar):
    - Anorthite leaching/processing: CaO by-product
    - Carbothermal reduction: CaAl2Si2O8 + C → CaO + Al2O3 + Si
    - Thermal decomposition: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 (if carbonates available)
  Nitrogen mass balance (Solvay + recovery):
    - N atoms in: NH3 (Solvay input)
    - N atoms out: NH3 (recovered from NH4Cl)
    - Net consumption: ~2-3% loss per cycle
    - Must make up with Haber-Bosch from volatiles
  Integration with chlorine chemistry:
    - NaCl → HCl → various chlorides → recycling
    - NH3 enables NaCl utilization via Solvay
    - CaCl2 enables FFC metal extraction
    - Closed-loop system minimizes reagent imports
  Temperature control:
    - Too low (<200°C): Incomplete NH3 liberation
    - Optimal (250-350°C): Good NH3 recovery, manageable
    - Too high (>400°C): May decompose CaCl2 to CaO + Cl2
  Safety considerations:
    - NH3 is toxic and corrosive
    - Must contain and capture all NH3 gas
    - Proper ventilation and scrubbing systems
    - CaO is caustic (handle with care)
  Yield optimization:
    - Molar ratio: 2 NH4Cl : 1 CaO (stoichiometric)
    - Slight excess CaO (5-10%) ensures complete reaction
    - Ammonia recovery: >95% typical
