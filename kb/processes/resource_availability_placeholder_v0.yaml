notes: |
  Abstract placeholder process for resources that are inherently available.
  Used for: computing_time, abstract services, conceptual resources.
  This is not a manufacturing process - it represents resource availability.
  Actual outputs are specified in recipes that use this process.
provenance: hand_assumption
assumptions: |
  Some resources (computing time, abstract services) don't require manufacturing.
  This process serves as a KB placeholder to satisfy closure requirements.
