  Generation of hydrochloric acid gas from sodium chloride using nitric acid.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, Lunar-Demandite.txt
  Reaction: NaCl + HNO3 → HCl + NaNO3
  Temperature: Moderate heating (80-160°C for HCl gas evolution)
  Process: Acid displacement - stronger acid displaces weaker from salt
  Purpose: Generate HCl for artificial weathering and chlorine chemistry
  Critical enabler for NaCl-based reagent recycling
  Process details:
    1. NaCl (solid salt, imported from Earth as recycled reagent)
    2. React with HNO3 (from Ostwald process)
    3. HCl gas evolved, collected by condensation or absorption
    4. NaNO3 (sodium nitrate/saltpetre) remains as solid
  Products:
    - HCl (hydrochloric acid gas): Artificial weathering, chlorine source
    - NaNO3 (sodium nitrate/saltpetre): Oxidizer, nitrogen storage
  HCl applications (critical):
    - Anorthite leaching: CaAl2Si2O8 + 8HCl → products (recycled HCl)
    - Carbochlorination: Provides Cl2 source
    - Silicon purification: Si + 3HCl → SiHCl3 (recycled HCl)
    - Rochow process: Forms CH3Cl for silicone synthesis
    - All processes recycle HCl - not consumed
  NaCl recycling chain:
    1. NaCl (import) + HNO3 → HCl + NaNO3
    2. HCl used in processes, regenerated
    3. NaNO3 + KCl → NaCl + KNO3 (recovers NaCl)
    - KCl from orthoclase processing
  Stoichiometry: NaCl (58.5g) + HNO3 (63g) → HCl (36.5g) + NaNO3 (85g)
  Mass fractions: 62.4% HCl, 145% NaNO3 from NaCl input
  Nitric acid source: Ostwald process from ammonia
  Nitrogen conservation: NaNO3 stores nitrogen as saltpetre
  Advantages: Simple acid-base chemistry
  Enables all chlorine chemistry from single NaCl import
  HCl recycled through all downstream processes
  NaNO3 useful as oxidizer and N storage
  Disadvantages: Requires scarce nitrogen (via HNO3)
  NaCl must be imported from Earth (scarce on Moon)
  Multi-step process to establish reagents
  Lunar context: NaCl is THE key imported reagent
  Small amounts recycled extensively
  Unlocks silicone plastics, artificial weathering, FFC electrolyte
  Critical bottleneck: Nitrogen for HNO3 production
  Alternative: Chloralkali electrolysis (2NaCl + 2H2O → 2NaOH + Cl2 + H2)
  But this consumes NaCl rather than recycling it
