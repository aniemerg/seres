  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, Power-on-the-Moon-using-ISRU.txt\nReaction:\
  \ SiHCl3 + H2 → Si + 3HCl (at 1150°C)\nTemperature: 1150°C (resistive heating of\
  \ silicon seed rods)\nProcess: Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on heated silicon\
  \ rods\nPurpose: Deposit ultra-pure polysilicon for electronics and solar cells\n\
  Second stage of Siemens process\nProcess details:\n  1. SiHCl3 vapor (from stage\
  \ 1) mixed with excess H2\n  2. Flow over resistively-heated silicon seed rods at\
  \ 1150°C\n  3. SiHCl3 thermally decomposes, depositing Si on rods\n  4. HCl gas\
  \ released, condensed, and recycled to stage 1\n  5. Rods grow in diameter over\
  \ 24-48 hours\n  6. Break rods into chunks (polysilicon)\nProducts:\n  - Polysilicon\
  \ (ultra-pure, 9-11 nines purity)\n  - HCl gas (recycled to stage 1 chlorination)\n\
  Silicon seed rods:\n  - Initial thin rods of metallurgical or polysilicon\n  - Electrically\
  \ heated by passing current through them\n  - Si deposits on surface, growing rod\
  \ diameter\n  - Can grow from ~8mm to 150-200mm diameter\nStoichiometry: SiHCl3\
  \ (135.5g) + H2 (2g) → Si (28g) + 3HCl (109.5g)\nMass fractions: 20.7% Si, 80.7%\
  \ HCl from SiHCl3 input\nHCl recycling: All HCl returned to stage 1\nNet process:\
  \ Metallurgical Si → Ultra-pure polysilicon (via closed loop)\nPurity achieved:\
  \ 99.9999999% to 99.999999999% (9N to 11N)\nImpurity levels: <1 ppb (part per billion)\
  \ for most elements\nAdvantages: Highest purity silicon available\nComplete HCl\
  \ recycling (closed loop with stage 1)\nStandard industrial process (well-proven)\n\
  Suitable for both electronics and solar applications\nDisadvantages: Extremely energy\
  \ intensive (150-200 kWh/kg total)\nVery slow (1-2 days per batch)\nHigh temperature\
  \ requirement\nBatch process (not continuous)\nApplications:\n  - Electronics: Czochralski\
  \ → single crystal → wafers → ICs\n  - Solar cells: High-efficiency (20-25%) photovoltaics\n\
  \  - Sensors: Photodetectors, pressure sensors, MEMS\nLunar/space context: Critical\
  \ for in-situ electronics manufacturing\nSolar cells for power generation\nSensors\
  \ and computing for automation\nAlternative: Float-zone refining for even higher\
  \ purity (12N)\nNext step: Czochralski or float-zone for single-crystal silicon\n"
