  Siemens process stage 2: Chemical vapor deposition of ultra-pure polysilicon.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, Power-on-the-Moon-using-ISRU.txt
  Reaction: SiHCl3 + H2 → Si + 3HCl (at 1150°C)
  Temperature: 1150°C (resistive heating of silicon seed rods)
  Process: Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on heated silicon rods
  Purpose: Deposit ultra-pure polysilicon for electronics and solar cells
  Second stage of Siemens process
  Process details:
    1. SiHCl3 vapor (from stage 1) mixed with excess H2
    2. Flow over resistively-heated silicon seed rods at 1150°C
    3. SiHCl3 thermally decomposes, depositing Si on rods
    4. HCl gas released, condensed, and recycled to stage 1
    5. Rods grow in diameter over 24-48 hours
    6. Break rods into chunks (polysilicon)
  Products:
    - Polysilicon (ultra-pure, 9-11 nines purity)
    - HCl gas (recycled to stage 1 chlorination)
  Silicon seed rods:
    - Initial thin rods of metallurgical or polysilicon
    - Electrically heated by passing current through them
    - Si deposits on surface, growing rod diameter
    - Can grow from ~8mm to 150-200mm diameter
  Stoichiometry: SiHCl3 (135.5g) + H2 (2g) → Si (28g) + 3HCl (109.5g)
  Mass fractions: 20.7% Si, 80.7% HCl from SiHCl3 input
  HCl recycling: All HCl returned to stage 1
  Net process: Metallurgical Si → Ultra-pure polysilicon (via closed loop)
  Purity achieved: 99.9999999% to 99.999999999% (9N to 11N)
  Impurity levels: <1 ppb (part per billion) for most elements
  Advantages: Highest purity silicon available
  Complete HCl recycling (closed loop with stage 1)
  Standard industrial process (well-proven)
  Suitable for both electronics and solar applications
  Disadvantages: Extremely energy intensive (150-200 kWh/kg total)
  Very slow (1-2 days per batch)
  High temperature requirement
  Batch process (not continuous)
  Applications:
    - Electronics: Czochralski → single crystal → wafers → ICs
    - Solar cells: High-efficiency (20-25%) photovoltaics
    - Sensors: Photodetectors, pressure sensors, MEMS
  Lunar/space context: Critical for in-situ electronics manufacturing
  Solar cells for power generation
  Sensors and computing for automation
  Alternative: Float-zone refining for even higher purity (12N)
  Next step: Czochralski or float-zone for single-crystal silicon
