notes: "Basic metal forming operations including bending, rolling, stamping, and pressing. Transforms flat sheet metal or plate into formed shapes (brackets, channels, tubes, tanks, curved panels). Methods include hydraulic press forming, brake bending, and rolling. Typically performed at room temperature for mild steel, aluminum, and copper. May require multiple forming steps for complex shapes. 5% material loss due to trimming and edge finishing. Used to create structural components, enclosures, tanks, and machine parts."
