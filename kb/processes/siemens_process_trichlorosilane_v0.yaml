  Siemens process stage 1: Silicon chlorination to produce trichlorosilane.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, Power-on-the-Moon-using-ISRU.txt
  Reaction: Si + 3HCl → SiHCl3 + H2 (at 300°C)
  Temperature: 300°C
  Process: Gas-solid chlorination in fluidized bed
  Purpose: Purify metallurgical-grade silicon to semiconductor/solar grade
  First stage of two-stage Siemens process
  Process details:
    1. Metallurgical Si powder (99% pure from carbothermal/FFC)
    2. React with HCl gas at 300°C in fluidized bed
    3. SiHCl3 (trichlorosilane) forms as liquid (BP 31.8°C)
    4. Distillation purifies SiHCl3 (removes impurities)
    5. H2 gas by-product collected
  Products:
    - SiHCl3 (trichlorosilane): Intermediate for polysilicon production
    - H2 (hydrogen): Recycled for stage 2 reduction
  Metallurgical silicon sources:
    - Carbothermal reduction: CaAl2Si2O8 + 4C → 2Si + ...
    - FFC Cambridge: SiO2 → Si + O2
    - Carbothermal methane: MgSiO3 + 2CH4 → Si + ...
  SiHCl3 purification:
    - Fractional distillation removes metal chlorides (BCl3, PCl3, etc.)
    - Achieves ppb-level purity (parts per billion)
    - Critical for electronics and high-efficiency solar cells
  Stoichiometry: Si (28g) + 3HCl (109.5g) → SiHCl3 (135.5g) + H2 (2g)
  Mass fractions: 483% SiHCl3, 7.2% H2 from Si input
  HCl recycling: Stage 2 regenerates HCl for re-use here
  Overall Siemens process (both stages):
    - This stage: Si + 3HCl → SiHCl3 + H2
    - Stage 2: SiHCl3 + H2 → Si + 3HCl (see companion process)
    - Net: Metallurgical Si → Ultra-pure polysilicon
  Advantages: Achieves ultra-high purity (9-11 nines: 99.9999999-99.999999999%)
  HCl fully recycled between two stages
  Standard industrial process for semiconductor Si
  Disadvantages: Two-stage process complexity
  Energy intensive overall
  Requires HCl (from NaCl-based chlorine chemistry)
  Lunar/space applications: Essential for electronics manufacturing
  High-efficiency solar cells (>20% vs <15% for metallurgical)
  Integrated circuits, sensors, processors
