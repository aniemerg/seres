  value: 3.0
  unit: kWh
  notes: Heating to stress relief temperature (typically 500-700°C) and controlled
    cool-down
time_model:
  type: batch
  hr_per_batch: 0.8
  notes: Includes heat-up, soak time at temperature, and controlled cooling
notes: Stress relief heat treatment for welded or machined parts. Reduces residual
  stresses from manufacturing processes by heating to subcritical temperature and
  slow cooling. Improves dimensional stability and reduces risk of cracking.
