  value: 3.0
  notes: "Heating to stress relief temperature (typically 500-700°C) and controlled cool-down"

time_model:
  type: linear_rate
  hr_per_kg: 0.8
  notes: "Includes heat-up, soak time at temperature, and controlled cooling"

notes: "Stress relief heat treatment for welded or machined parts. Reduces residual stresses from manufacturing processes by heating to subcritical temperature and slow cooling. Improves dimensional stability and reduces risk of cracking."
