notes: 'TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding process for precision joining.

  Also known as GTAW (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding).

  Used for stainless steel, aluminum, and critical high-quality welds.

  Produces clean, precise welds with minimal spatter.

  Slower than MIG but produces superior weld quality.

  Required for leak-tight joints in pressure vessels and cryogenic equipment.
