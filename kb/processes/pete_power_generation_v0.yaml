  Photon-Enhanced Thermionic Emission (PETE) power generation system.
  Source: ellery-et-al-2022-metalysis-fray-farthing-chen-process
  Purpose: Advanced power conversion combining photovoltaic and thermionic effects
  Efficiency: Up to 50% (theoretical), 30-40% (practical)
  Temperature: 1000-1500°C cathode temperature
  Significantly more efficient than photovoltaics alone (~15-20%)
  Process details:
    1. Concentrated solar radiation focused onto PETE cathode
    2. Photovoltaic stage: Photons excite electrons to conduction band
       - Semiconductor absorbs photons (hν > Eg)
       - Electron-hole pairs generated
       - Reduces effective work function
    3. Thermionic stage: Hot cathode emits electrons into vacuum
       - Temperature 1000-1500°C
       - Electrons overcome reduced work function barrier
       - Richardson-Dushman equation: J = AT² exp(-φ/kT)
    4. Electrons travel across vacuum gap to cold anode
    5. External circuit carries electrons back to cathode (generates power)
    6. Waste heat removed from anode via heat exchanger
    7. Can use waste heat for thermal processes (ISRU, FFC Cambridge)
  PETE cathode structure:
    - Base: Tungsten or molybdenum substrate (high melting point)
    - Active layer: Aluminum-doped hematite (α-Fe2O3:Al)
      - Produced from ilmenite-derived iron + oxygen + Al dopant
      - Bandgap: ~2 eV (absorbs visible and near-IR)
      - Work function: ~1 eV (reduced by photon excitation)
    - Alternative: Cesiated surfaces (Ba-O-Cs coatings)
  Physics:
    - Thermionic work function: φ = 1-2 eV typical
    - Photovoltaic reduces effective φ by photo-excitation
    - Combined effect: Higher current density than pure thermionic
    - Efficiency: η = (1 - Tc/Th) × (photon utilization factor)
  Cathode temperature optimization:
    - Too low (<1000°C): Insufficient thermionic emission
    - Optimal (1200-1400°C): Maximum combined effect
    - Too high (>1500°C): Material degradation, thermal losses
  Anode (collector):
    - Cool surface (<500°C) to maintain voltage
    - High work function material (not critical)
    - Heat extraction via radiator or heat pipe
  Vacuum requirements:
    - High vacuum (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁸ torr) to prevent electron scattering
    - Spacing: 1-10 μm gap (close spacing improves efficiency)
    - Challenges: Thermal expansion, alignment
  Efficiency breakdown:
    - Photovoltaic stage: ~20-25% (photon → excited electrons)
    - Thermionic stage: ~25-30% (thermal → electron kinetic energy)
    - Combined: ~50% theoretical maximum
    - Practical: 30-40% (accounting for losses)
  Comparison to other power systems:
    - Photovoltaics: ~15-20% (single junction), ~30% (multi-junction)
    - Thermionic: ~20% (pure thermionic, Russian nuclear reactors)
    - PETE: ~40-50% (combined photovoltaic + thermionic)
    - Lunar advantage: More efficient use of solar energy
  Advantages: Very high efficiency (40-50%)
    Uses lunar materials (Fe2O3 from ilmenite, W from meteorites)
    Generates useful waste heat (1000+ °C) for ISRU
    No moving parts (solid-state)
    Long lifetime (no wear mechanisms)
  Disadvantages: Requires high vacuum (challenging to maintain)
    High operating temperature (material constraints)
    Close cathode-anode spacing (precision alignment)
    Requires concentrated solar (not direct sunlight)
    Complex fabrication (thin-film cathode coatings)
  Lunar context: Abundant solar energy (no atmosphere)
    14-day illumination periods (long operational time)
    High vacuum natural environment (Moon's surface)
    Can couple with ISRU thermal processes (use waste heat)
    Ideal for high-power applications (manufacturing, smelting)
  Materials:
    - Cathode substrate: Tungsten (from meteorites, density separation)
    - Cathode coating: α-Fe2O3:Al (from ilmenite + aluminum)
    - Anode: Molybdenum, nickel, or stainless steel
    - Vacuum envelope: Fused silica or metal (lunar glass/metal)
  Cathode coating synthesis:
    - Start with Fe from ilmenite reduction
    - Oxidize in O2 atmosphere: 2Fe + 3/2 O2 → Fe2O3 (hematite)
    - Dope with Al: Replace ~5% Fe with Al (improves conductivity)
    - Sinter at 1200-1400°C to densify
    - Result: α-Fe2O3:Al semiconductor with ~2 eV bandgap
  Solar concentration:
    - Typical: 100-1000 suns (100,000-1,000,000 W/m²)
    - Fresnel lenses, parabolic mirrors, or heliostats
    - Achieves 1200-1400°C cathode temperature
  Power output scaling:
    - Current density: 10-50 A/cm² (at 1200°C, 1.5V)
    - Power density: 15-75 W/cm²
    - For 1 kW output: 13-67 cm² cathode area
    - Modular design: Scale by number of converters
  Waste heat utilization:
    - Anode at 500-800°C (substantial thermal energy)
    - Use for FFC Cambridge (900-1100°C after heat pump)
    - Or other thermal processes (glass melting, sintering)
    - Combined heat and power (CHP): Overall >70% energy utilization
  Vacuum maintenance:
    - Getter materials: Absorb residual gases (Ba, Ti getters)
    - Seal integrity: High-temperature seals (glass-metal, ceramic)
    - Lunar vacuum: Natural environment (10⁻¹⁴ torr)
    - Can operate in lunar ambient vacuum (no envelope needed!)
  Operational modes:
    - Day: PETE power generation (14 Earth days continuous)
    - Night: Shutdown, cool down (14 Earth days)
    - Thermal cycling: Design for repeated cycling
  Reliability and lifetime:
    - Solid-state (no moving parts): Long lifetime expected
    - Material degradation: Cathode coating evaporation at high T
    - Estimated lifetime: 10-20 years (with proper design)
  Development status (terrestrial):
    - Research stage (laboratory demonstrations)
    - Stanford, MIT research programs
    - Not yet commercial
    - Significant engineering challenges remain
  Lunar advantages over terrestrial:
    - Natural vacuum (no envelope needed or simplified)
    - Concentrated solar easily achievable
    - Heat rejection via radiation (no atmosphere)
    - Long illumination periods (14-day "day")
  Integration with lunar ISRU:
    1. Solar concentration → PETE cathode → electrical power
    2. PETE waste heat → FFC Cambridge electrolysis → metals + O2
    3. Metals → manufacturing (structures, machines)
    4. Electrical power → water electrolysis, mining, robotics
    5. Closed-loop energy conversion system
  Efficiency comparison (solar → useful work):
    - PV + resistive heating: 15% electric, 85% waste (unusable)
    - PETE + waste heat recovery: 40% electric, 50% useful heat, 10% loss
    - Net useful energy: PETE vastly superior for thermal processes
  Research needs:
    - Optimize cathode coating (composition, thickness, doping)
    - Improve vacuum sealing (or open-vacuum lunar design)
    - Thermal management (heat pipes, radiators)
    - Cathode-anode spacing control (thermal expansion compensation)
    - Long-term stability testing (evaporation, degradation)
  Recommended development timeline:
    - Phase 1 (years 0-10): Import terrestrial solar panels (PV)
    - Phase 2 (years 10-30): Develop PETE prototypes on Moon
    - Phase 3 (years 30+): Deploy PETE for high-power ISRU applications
  Critical enabler for:
    - Large-scale FFC Cambridge (requires electrical + thermal energy)
    - Smelting operations (coupled power + heat)
    - Materials processing (manufacturing infrastructure)
  Comparison to nuclear power:
    - Nuclear: Continuous power (day and night)
    - PETE: Intermittent (14-day on, 14-day off)
    - Nuclear: Higher complexity, safety concerns, waste
    - PETE: Simpler, safer, but requires energy storage for night
  Energy storage pairing:
    - PETE day: Generate power + charge batteries
    - Night: Discharge batteries or shutdown non-critical loads
    - Alternatively: Locate near polar craters (near-continuous sunlight)
  Polar deployment:
    - Peaks of eternal light: 80-90% sunlight availability
    - Shackleton crater rim: Nearly continuous illumination
    - Ideal for PETE (minimizes cycling, maximizes uptime)
