  \ ellery-et-al-2022-metalysis-fray-farthing-chen-process\nPurpose: Advanced power\
  \ conversion combining photovoltaic and thermionic effects\nEfficiency: Up to 50%\
  \ (theoretical), 30-40% (practical)\nTemperature: 1000-1500°C cathode temperature\n\
  Significantly more efficient than photovoltaics alone (~15-20%)\nProcess details:\n\
  \  1. Concentrated solar radiation focused onto PETE cathode\n  2. Photovoltaic\
  \ stage: Photons excite electrons to conduction band\n     - Semiconductor absorbs\
  \ photons (hν > Eg)\n     - Electron-hole pairs generated\n     - Reduces effective\
  \ work function\n  3. Thermionic stage: Hot cathode emits electrons into vacuum\n\
  \     - Temperature 1000-1500°C\n     - Electrons overcome reduced work function\
  \ barrier\n     - Richardson-Dushman equation: J = AT² exp(-φ/kT)\n  4. Electrons\
  \ travel across vacuum gap to cold anode\n  5. External circuit carries electrons\
  \ back to cathode (generates power)\n  6. Waste heat removed from anode via heat\
  \ exchanger\n  7. Can use waste heat for thermal processes (ISRU, FFC Cambridge)\n\
  PETE cathode structure:\n  - Base: Tungsten or molybdenum substrate (high melting\
  \ point)\n  - Active layer: Aluminum-doped hematite (α-Fe2O3:Al)\n    - Produced\
  \ from ilmenite-derived iron + oxygen + Al dopant\n    - Bandgap: ~2 eV (absorbs\
  \ visible and near-IR)\n    - Work function: ~1 eV (reduced by photon excitation)\n\
  \  - Alternative: Cesiated surfaces (Ba-O-Cs coatings)\nPhysics:\n  - Thermionic\
  \ work function: φ = 1-2 eV typical\n  - Photovoltaic reduces effective φ by photo-excitation\n\

  \ losses\nAnode (collector):\n  - Cool surface (<500°C) to maintain voltage\n  -\
  \ High work function material (not critical)\n  - Heat extraction via radiator or\
  \ heat pipe\nVacuum requirements:\n  - High vacuum (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁸ torr) to prevent\
  \ electron scattering\n  - Spacing: 1-10 μm gap (close spacing improves efficiency)\n\
