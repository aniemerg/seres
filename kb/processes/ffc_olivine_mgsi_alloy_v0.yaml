  Direct FFC Cambridge reduction of olivine to produce MgSi mongrel alloy.
  Source: FFC-process-for-deep-ISRU.txt
  Reaction: Mg2SiO4 → MgSi alloy + O2 (via electrolysis in CaCl2)
  Temperature: 900-1100°C (molten CaCl2 electrolyte)
  Voltage: 2.5-3V typical
  Process: Direct electrolytic reduction without preprocessing
  Purpose: Simple one-step alloy production from crater olivine deposits
  Alloying additive and specialty applications
  Process details:
    1. Olivine ore (Mg2SiO4 forsterite or Fe2SiO4 fayalite)
    2. Powder, compact, and sinter into cathode pellet
    3. Immerse in molten CaCl2 electrolyte at 900-1100°C
    4. Apply voltage (graphite anode)
    5. MgSi alloy (or MgFeSi for fayalite) forms at cathode
    6. Oxygen released at anode (CO/CO2 with graphite)
    7. Remove alloy sponge, process as needed
  Products:
    - MgSi alloy: Magnesium-silicon alloy
    - O2 (oxygen): High yield (45.5% by mass)
  Alloy composition (from forsterite Mg2SiO4):
    - Mg: 34.5% by mass
    - Si: 19.9% by mass
    - Total metal: 54.5% of olivine mass
  For fayalite (Fe2SiO4):
    - Fe: 49.2%, Si: 19.9%, total: 69.1%
  Mg2Si compound:
    - Intermetallic compound, not mechanical mixture
    - Used as strengthening agent in aluminum alloys
    - Improves strength, hardness, creep resistance
  Applications:
    - Aluminum alloying: Small Mg2Si additions strengthen Al
    - Thermoelectric materials: Mg2Si has thermoelectric properties
    - Semiconductor: Mg2Si is narrow-gap semiconductor
    - Pyrotechnic fuel: Mg + Si + oxidizer (ground into powder)
    - Hydrogen storage: Mg2Si can absorb/release H2
  Stoichiometry: Mg2SiO4 (140.7g) → 2Mg (48.6g) + Si (28.1g) + 2 O2 (64g)
  Total metals: 76.7g (54.5%), oxygen: 45.5%
  Fe contamination tolerance:
    - Most lunar olivine is mixed Mg-Fe composition
    - FeTiO3 olivine → MgFeSi alloy
    - Fe may or may not be problematic depending on use
  Advantages: Direct single-step process
    High oxygen yield (45.5%)
    Olivine common in crater ejecta and some maria
    Mg2Si useful as Al alloy additive
    Multiple potential applications
  Disadvantages: "Mongrel" alloy with uncertain properties
    Olivine less abundant than anorthite or ilmenite
    Mg vacuum outgassing concern (though in alloy form)
    Composition varies with olivine Mg/Fe ratio
    Not suitable for pure Mg or pure Si applications
  Comparison to pure metal routes:
    - Pidgeon: Mg2SiO4 + 2CaO → 2Mg + Ca2SiO4 (pure Mg vapor)
    - Carbothermal: Mg2SiO4 + 2C → 2Mg + SiO + 2CO (pure components)
    - FFC pure: Separate MgO and SiO2, then FFC each
    - FFC mongrel: Direct (simplest but mixed alloy)
  Lunar context: Olivine in crater regions and some maria
    Not as abundant as anorthite or ilmenite
    Suitable for specialty applications
    Mg2Si valuable for Al alloy strengthening
  Magnesium concerns:
    - Mg outgasses in vacuum (vapor pressure)
    - Problematic for structural use in vacuum
    - Better suited for enclosed environments
    - Or alloying additions where Mg is minority component
  Iron-bearing olivine (fayalite):
    - More common than pure forsterite
    - Fe2SiO4 → FeSi alloy + O2 (iron silicide)
    - May be more useful due to Fe inclusion
  Potential: Investigate MgSi and MgFeSi alloy properties
    Mechanical strength, stability in vacuum
    Thermoelectric performance
    Hydrogen storage capacity
    Applications in lunar context
