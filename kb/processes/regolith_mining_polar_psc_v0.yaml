name: Polar PSC Regolith Mining
description: |
  Excavation of ice-bearing regolith from permanently shadowed craters (PSCs)
  at lunar poles. Mining ice-cemented regolith requires specialized drilling
  equipment as the material is rock-hard at PSC temperatures (~40 K).

  Slower and more energy-intensive than loose regolith mining due to ice cement.

base_rate: "50 kg/hour"

inputs: []  # No consumables - regolith is free (but harder to mine)

time_model:
  type: linear_rate
  rate_kg_per_hr: 50
  notes: Lower rate than mare mining due to drilling ice-cemented material

energy_model:
  type: kWh_per_kg
  value: 0.5
  notes: |
    Higher energy than loose regolith mining (0.05 kWh/kg for mare).
    Drilling frozen ice-cemented regolith similar to drilling concrete.
    Includes heliostat power for lighting and equipment operation in PSC.

  Mining of ice-bearing regolith from permanently shadowed craters.

  Location: North and south pole PSCs
  Temperature: ~40 K (-233°C)
  Ice concentration: 5.6% ± 2.9% by mass

  Operational considerations:
  - PSCs are permanently dark (no direct sunlight)
  - Heliostats required: Reflect sunlight from peaks of eternal light
  - Heliostat distance: ~20 km vertical and horizontal
  - Alternative: Nuclear power for PSC operations

  Mining challenges:
  - Ice-cemented regolith is rock-hard (similar to concrete)
  - Requires drilling equipment (not just scooping)
  - Lower excavation rate than loose mare/highlands regolith
  - Higher energy per kg due to drilling
  - Extreme cold requires specialized equipment

  Rate justification:
  - Mare regolith (loose): 100 kg/hr with labor bot
  - PSC regolith (ice-cement): 50 kg/hr with labor bot + drilling equipment
  - Factor of 2x reduction due to hardness

  Energy justification:
  - Mare regolith: 0.05 kWh/kg (simple scooping)
  - PSC regolith: 0.5 kWh/kg (drilling + heliostat operation)
  - Factor of 10x increase for drilling hard material

  Infrastructure requirements:
  - Heliostat array on peaks of eternal light
  - Communication relay (PSCs are in radio shadow)
  - Thermal management (equipment must operate at 40 K or be insulated)
  - Power transmission from heliostats or nuclear source
