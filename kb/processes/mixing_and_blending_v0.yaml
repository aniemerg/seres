notes: "Mixing and blending of multiple materials to create homogeneous mixtures. Includes dry mixing of powders, wet mixing of liquids, paste mixing, and blending of composites. Methods: tumbler mixing, paddle mixing, ribbon blending, ball milling, or high-shear mixing. Used for creating alloy powders, ceramic slurries, composite materials, chemical formulations, and concrete/mortar. Mixing time and energy vary by material viscosity and desired homogeneity. Minimal material loss. Critical for material preparation in metallurgy, ceramics, composites, and chemical processing."
