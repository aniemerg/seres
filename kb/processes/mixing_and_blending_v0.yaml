notes: 'Mixing and blending of multiple materials to create homogeneous mixtures.
  Includes dry mixing of powders, wet mixing of liquids, paste mixing, and blending
  of composites. Methods: tumbler mixing, paddle mixing, ribbon blending, ball milling,
  or high-shear mixing. Used for creating alloy powders, ceramic slurries, composite
  materials, chemical formulations, and concrete/mortar. Mixing time and energy vary
  by material viscosity and desired homogeneity. Minimal material loss. Critical for
  material preparation in metallurgy, ceramics, composites, and chemical processing.'
