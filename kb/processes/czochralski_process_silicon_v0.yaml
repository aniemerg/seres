  Czochralski (CZ) process for growing single-crystal silicon ingots.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt
  Process: Seed crystal dipping and slow pulling from molten silicon
  Temperature: ~1600°C (silicon melting point: 1414°C, kept just above)
  Atmosphere: Vacuum or inert gas (argon) to prevent contamination
  Purpose: Convert polysilicon to single-crystal silicon
  Essential for electronics (integrated circuits, high-performance solar)
  Process details:
    1. Charge fused silica crucible_refractory with polysilicon chunks
    2. Heat to 1600°C in vacuum or argon atmosphere
    3. Dip seed crystal (known orientation, e.g., <100> or <111>) into melt
    4. Slowly pull seed upward while rotating (1-10 mm/min)
    5. Silicon solidifies on seed in single-crystal form
    6. Control pull rate and temperature to control diameter
    7. Typical ingot: 200-300mm diameter, 1-2m length
    8. Cool ingot, remove from puller
  Products:
    - Single-crystal silicon ingot (cylindrical boule)
    - Scrap polysilicon (cropped ends, re-melt)
  Seed crystal:
    - Small single-crystal silicon rod (oriented)
    - Determines crystal orientation of entire ingot
    - Common orientations: <100> (electronics), <111> (some applications)
  Crucible: Ceramic refractory (placeholder for fused silica or equivalent)
    - Slowly dissolves into melt (oxygen contamination source)
    - Replaced after each run or few runs
  Dopant addition: Can add B (p-type) or P/As (n-type) during growth
  Crystal quality:
    - Dislocation-free (or very low dislocation density)
    - Uniform crystal orientation throughout
    - Controlled resistivity via doping
  Stoichiometry: Polysilicon → Single-crystal silicon (95% yield)
    - 5% losses from cropping, surface defects
  Advantages: Produces large, high-quality single crystals
  Well-controlled process (diameter, doping, orientation)
  Standard for semiconductor industry
  Suitable for high-efficiency solar cells (>25%)
  Disadvantages: Energy intensive (80-100 kWh/kg)
  Slow process (12-24 hours per ingot)
  Requires ultra-pure polysilicon input
  Crucible consumption (SiO2)
  5% material loss
  Applications:
    - Electronics: Wafers → integrated circuits, processors, memory
    - Solar cells: High-efficiency monocrystalline panels
    - Sensors: MEMS, photodetectors, pressure sensors
    - Power devices: Rectifiers, thyristors, MOSFETs
  Post-processing: Ingot → sliced into wafers → polished → device fabrication
  Lunar/space context: Essential for in-situ electronics manufacturing
  Enables computational infrastructure
  High-efficiency solar power generation
  Sensors for robotic systems
  Alternative: Float-zone (FZ) process for higher purity, smaller diameter
