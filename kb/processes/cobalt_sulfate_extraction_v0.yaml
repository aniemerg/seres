notes: "Cobalt purification via sulfate roasting and electrowinning route.\nSource:\
  \ Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt\nProcess: Sulfate formation → aqueous leaching\
  \ → electrolytic deposition\nTemperature: 600-800°C for roasting, ambient for leaching,\
  \ ambient for electrowinning\nPurpose: Alternative to carbonyl process for cobalt\
  \ purification\nUseful when CO is scarce or sulfur is abundant\nProcess details:\n\
  \  1. Impure cobalt metal (from meteoritic NiFe material)\n  2. Roast with sulfur\
  \ in oxygen atmosphere\n  3. Reaction: 2Co + S + 2O2 → 2CoSO4 (cobalt sulfate)\n\
  \  4. Alternative: Co + S → CoS, then 2CoS + 3O2 → 2CoSO4\n  5. Cobalt sulfate is\
  \ water-soluble\n  6. Leach roasted material in water\n  7. CoSO4 dissolves, impurities\
  \ remain as residue\n  8. Filter solution to remove insoluble impurities\n  9. Electrowinning:\
  \ Cathode: Co²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Co (pure metal)\n  10. Anode: 2H2O → O2 + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻\n  11.\
  \ Pure cobalt metal deposits on cathode\nProducts:\n  - Pure cobalt metal: 95% yield,\
  \ >99% purity\n  - Cobalt sulfate solution: Recycled or retained for other uses\n\
  \  - Process water: Recycled\n  - Oxygen: From electrowinning anode reaction\nStoichiometry:\n\
  \  - Roasting: 2Co (118g) + S (32g) + 2O2 (64g) → 2CoSO4 (310g)\n  - Leaching: CoSO4\
  \ + 7H2O → CoSO4·7H2O (soluble)\n  - Electrowinning: Co²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Co\nRoasting chemistry:\n\
  \  - Direct sulfation: 2Co + S + 2O2 → 2CoSO4 (preferred)\n  - Or two-stage: Co\
  \ + S → CoS, then 2CoS + 3O2 → 2CoSO4\n  - Temperature: 600-800°C (avoid Co3O4 formation)\n\
  \  - Atmosphere: Excess oxygen ensures complete sulfation\nLeaching chemistry:\n\
  \  - CoSO4 very soluble in water (36.1g/100mL at 20°C)\n  - Forms pink solution\
  \ (Co²⁺ hydrated complex)\n  - pH control important (slightly acidic, pH 4-6)\n\
  \  - Impurities (Fe, Ni, Si) remain insoluble or precipitate\nElectrowinning parameters:\n\
  \  - Electrolyte: CoSO4 solution (100-150 g/L Co)\n  - Anode: Inert (Pb, graphite,\
  \ or dimensionally stable anode)\n  - Cathode: Stainless steel or titanium starter\
  \ sheet\n  - Current density: 200-400 A/m²\n  - Voltage: 2.5-3.5V\n  - Temperature:\
  \ 40-60°C (moderate heating improves kinetics)\nPurity and yield:\n  - Cobalt purity:\
  \ >99% (high-purity from electrolytic deposition)\n  - Yield: 95% (5% losses to\
  \ solution, residues)\nApplications of pure cobalt:\n  - Superalloys: High-temperature\
  \ turbine blades (Co-Cr-W)\n  - Magnets: SmCo, AlNiCo permanent magnets\n  - Catalysts:\
  \ Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation\n  - Batteries: LiCoO2 cathodes (lithium-ion\
  \ batteries)\n  - Tool steel: Cobalt-tungsten high-speed steel\n  - Hard facing:\
  \ Wear-resistant coatings (stellite)\nAdvantages: Does not require CO (unlike carbonyl\
  \ process)\n  Water-based chemistry (simpler than gas-phase)\n  High purity from\
  \ electrowinning\n  Sulfur can be recovered from troilite (FeS in meteorites)\n\
  \  Scalable process\nDisadvantages: Multi-step process (roasting, leaching, electrowinning)\n\
  \  Requires sulfur input (consumable)\n  Energy for roasting and electrolysis\n\
  \  Aqueous processing requires water (recycled but needed)\nComparison to carbonyl\
  \ process:\n  - Carbonyl: Co + 4CO ⇌ Co2(CO)8 (gas) → Co (at 150°C, 35 bar)\n  -\
  \ Sulfate: Solid-liquid-electrochemical route\n  - Carbonyl: Higher purity, lower\
  \ temperature, requires CO\n  - Sulfate: More robust, works with impure feed, requires\
  \ sulfur\nLunar context: Cobalt extremely scarce (meteoritic only)\n  Must extract\
  \ from NiFe meteorite material with high efficiency\n  Sulfur available from troilite\
  \ (FeS) in meteorites\n  Sulfate route viable if sulfur abundant locally\n  Carbonyl\
  \ route preferred if CO available (from FFC or Boudouard)\nSulfur recovery from\
  \ troilite:\n  - FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2 (or FeS roasting → Fe2O3 + SO2)\n  - Claus\
  \ process: SO2 + H2S → S + H2O\n  - Sulfur for cobalt sulfate roasting\nImpurity\
  \ removal:\n  - Iron: Precipitates as Fe(OH)3 at pH 4-6\n  - Nickel: May co-extract;\
  \ separate by selective precipitation\n  - Copper: More noble, may co-deposit (use\
  \ current control)\n  - Silicon: Insoluble, removed in leaching residue\nProcess\
  \ optimization:\n  - Roasting: Optimize S:Co ratio (slight excess S)\n  - Leaching:\
  \ Multiple stages for maximum extraction\n  - Electrowinning: Control current density\
  \ to avoid dendritic growth\nSolution recycling:\n  - Spent electrolyte (depleted\
  \ CoSO4) returned to leaching\n  - Continuous process with solution recirculation\n\
  \  - Make-up sulfuric acid as needed\nAlternative precipitation route:\n  - CoSO4\
  \ + 2NaOH → Co(OH)2 + Na2SO4\n  - Co(OH)2 → CoO + H2O (at 200°C)\n  - CoO + H2 →\
  \ Co + H2O (hydrogen reduction)\n  - Avoids electrowinning but requires H2\nCobalt\
  \ hydroxide (intermediate):\n  - Pink precipitate, Co(OH)2\n  - Can be thermally\
  \ decomposed to CoO (black)\n  - CoO reduced to Co with H2 or C\nEnvironmental considerations:\n\
  \  - Cobalt sulfate toxic (handle with care)\n  - Must contain all solutions (closed-loop\
  \ processing)\n  - Electrowinning produces O2 (useful by-product)\n"
