  Cobalt purification via sulfate roasting and electrowinning route.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt
  Process: Sulfate formation → aqueous leaching → electrolytic deposition
  Temperature: 600-800°C for roasting, ambient for leaching, ambient for electrowinning
  Purpose: Alternative to carbonyl process for cobalt purification
  Useful when CO is scarce or sulfur is abundant
  Process details:
    1. Impure cobalt metal (from meteoritic NiFe material)
    2. Roast with sulfur in oxygen atmosphere
    3. Reaction: 2Co + S + 2O2 → 2CoSO4 (cobalt sulfate)
    4. Alternative: Co + S → CoS, then 2CoS + 3O2 → 2CoSO4
    5. Cobalt sulfate is water-soluble
    6. Leach roasted material in water
    7. CoSO4 dissolves, impurities remain as residue
    8. Filter solution to remove insoluble impurities
    9. Electrowinning: Cathode: Co²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Co (pure metal)
    10. Anode: 2H2O → O2 + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻
    11. Pure cobalt metal deposits on cathode
  Products:
    - Pure cobalt metal: 95% yield, >99% purity
    - Cobalt sulfate solution: Recycled or retained for other uses
    - Process water: Recycled
    - Oxygen: From electrowinning anode reaction
  Stoichiometry:
    - Roasting: 2Co (118g) + S (32g) + 2O2 (64g) → 2CoSO4 (310g)
    - Leaching: CoSO4 + 7H2O → CoSO4·7H2O (soluble)
    - Electrowinning: Co²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Co
  Roasting chemistry:
    - Direct sulfation: 2Co + S + 2O2 → 2CoSO4 (preferred)
    - Or two-stage: Co + S → CoS, then 2CoS + 3O2 → 2CoSO4
    - Temperature: 600-800°C (avoid Co3O4 formation)
    - Atmosphere: Excess oxygen ensures complete sulfation
  Leaching chemistry:
    - CoSO4 very soluble in water (36.1g/100mL at 20°C)
    - Forms pink solution (Co²⁺ hydrated complex)
    - pH control important (slightly acidic, pH 4-6)
    - Impurities (Fe, Ni, Si) remain insoluble or precipitate
  Electrowinning parameters:
    - Electrolyte: CoSO4 solution (100-150 g/L Co)
    - Anode: Inert (Pb, graphite, or dimensionally stable anode)
    - Cathode: Stainless steel or titanium starter sheet
    - Current density: 200-400 A/m²
    - Voltage: 2.5-3.5V
    - Temperature: 40-60°C (moderate heating improves kinetics)
  Purity and yield:
    - Cobalt purity: >99% (high-purity from electrolytic deposition)
    - Yield: 95% (5% losses to solution, residues)
  Applications of pure cobalt:
    - Superalloys: High-temperature turbine blades (Co-Cr-W)
    - Magnets: SmCo, AlNiCo permanent magnets
    - Catalysts: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation
    - Batteries: LiCoO2 cathodes (lithium-ion batteries)
    - Tool steel: Cobalt-tungsten high-speed steel
    - Hard facing: Wear-resistant coatings (stellite)
  Advantages: Does not require CO (unlike carbonyl process)
    Water-based chemistry (simpler than gas-phase)
    High purity from electrowinning
    Sulfur can be recovered from troilite (FeS in meteorites)
    Scalable process
  Disadvantages: Multi-step process (roasting, leaching, electrowinning)
    Requires sulfur input (consumable)
    Energy for roasting and electrolysis
    Aqueous processing requires water (recycled but needed)
  Comparison to carbonyl process:
    - Carbonyl: Co + 4CO ⇌ Co2(CO)8 (gas) → Co (at 150°C, 35 bar)
    - Sulfate: Solid-liquid-electrochemical route
    - Carbonyl: Higher purity, lower temperature, requires CO
    - Sulfate: More robust, works with impure feed, requires sulfur
  Lunar context: Cobalt extremely scarce (meteoritic only)
    Must extract from NiFe meteorite material with high efficiency
    Sulfur available from troilite (FeS) in meteorites
    Sulfate route viable if sulfur abundant locally
    Carbonyl route preferred if CO available (from FFC or Boudouard)
  Sulfur recovery from troilite:
    - FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2 (or FeS roasting → Fe2O3 + SO2)
    - Claus process: SO2 + H2S → S + H2O
    - Sulfur for cobalt sulfate roasting
  Impurity removal:
    - Iron: Precipitates as Fe(OH)3 at pH 4-6
    - Nickel: May co-extract; separate by selective precipitation
    - Copper: More noble, may co-deposit (use current control)
    - Silicon: Insoluble, removed in leaching residue
  Process optimization:
    - Roasting: Optimize S:Co ratio (slight excess S)
    - Leaching: Multiple stages for maximum extraction
    - Electrowinning: Control current density to avoid dendritic growth
  Solution recycling:
    - Spent electrolyte (depleted CoSO4) returned to leaching
    - Continuous process with solution recirculation
    - Make-up sulfuric acid as needed
  Alternative precipitation route:
    - CoSO4 + 2NaOH → Co(OH)2 + Na2SO4
    - Co(OH)2 → CoO + H2O (at 200°C)
    - CoO + H2 → Co + H2O (hydrogen reduction)
    - Avoids electrowinning but requires H2
  Cobalt hydroxide (intermediate):
    - Pink precipitate, Co(OH)2
    - Can be thermally decomposed to CoO (black)
    - CoO reduced to Co with H2 or C
  Environmental considerations:
    - Cobalt sulfate toxic (handle with care)
    - Must contain all solutions (closed-loop processing)
    - Electrowinning produces O2 (useful by-product)
