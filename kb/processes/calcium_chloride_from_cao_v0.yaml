  Source: FFC-process-for-deep-ISRU.txt, Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt\nReaction:\
  \ CaO + 2HCl → CaCl2 + H2O (highly exothermic)\nTemperature: Exothermic reaction\
  \ (releases heat), then dry at 200-300°C\nProcess: Acid-base neutralization followed\
  \ by dehydration\nPurpose: Generate CaCl2 for FFC Cambridge electrolyte replenishment\n\
  Utilize CaO by-product from anorthite processing\nClose chlorine recycling loop\n\
  Process details:\n  1. CaO (quicklime) from anorthite carbothermal reduction\n \
  \ 2. React with HCl (from artificial weathering, recycled)\n  3. Highly exothermic\
  \ - temperature rises significantly\n  4. CaCl2 solution forms, then dry to anhydrous\
  \ salt\n  5. Water condensed and separated\nProducts:\n  - CaCl2 (anhydrous calcium\
  \ chloride): FFC electrolyte, desiccant\n  - H2O (water): Process water, recyclable\n\
  CaO source: CaAl2Si2O8 + 4C → CaO + Al2O3 + 2Si + 4CO\nHCl source: Recycled from\
  \ anorthite leaching or other chlorine processes\nFFC Cambridge electrolyte:\n \
  \ - Molten CaCl2 bath at 900-1100°C\n  - Losses from cathode porosity and handling\
  \ (~10%)\n  - This process replenishes lost electrolyte\nStoichiometry: CaO (56g)\
  \ + 2HCl (73g) → CaCl2 (111g) + H2O (18g)\nMass fractions: 198% CaCl2 from CaO input\n\
  Advantages: Simple exothermic reaction\nUtilizes waste CaO from preprocessing\n\
  Replenishes critical FFC electrolyte\nHCl recycled (not consumed overall)\nDisadvantages:\
  \ Highly exothermic (requires careful control)\nDrying step needed for anhydrous\
  \ salt\nLunar context: CaO abundant from anorthite (70-95% of highlands)\nCritical\
  \ for maintaining FFC operations\nCloses calcium-chlorine loop:\n  CaAl2Si2O8 →\
  \ CaO → CaCl2 (FFC) → repeat\nAlternative use: Desiccant, road de-icing (Earth),\
  \ dust control\nHeat of reaction can be recovered for other processes\nEssential\
  \ process for FFC Cambridge sustainability\n"
