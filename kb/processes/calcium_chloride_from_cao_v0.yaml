  Production of calcium chloride from calcium oxide and hydrochloric acid.
  Source: FFC-process-for-deep-ISRU.txt, Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt
  Reaction: CaO + 2HCl → CaCl2 + H2O (highly exothermic)
  Temperature: Exothermic reaction (releases heat), then dry at 200-300°C
  Process: Acid-base neutralization followed by dehydration
  Purpose: Generate CaCl2 for FFC Cambridge electrolyte replenishment
  Utilize CaO by-product from anorthite processing
  Close chlorine recycling loop
  Process details:
    1. CaO (quicklime) from anorthite carbothermal reduction
    2. React with HCl (from artificial weathering, recycled)
    3. Highly exothermic - temperature rises significantly
    4. CaCl2 solution forms, then dry to anhydrous salt
    5. Water condensed and separated
  Products:
    - CaCl2 (anhydrous calcium chloride): FFC electrolyte, desiccant
    - H2O (water): Process water, recyclable
  CaO source: CaAl2Si2O8 + 4C → CaO + Al2O3 + 2Si + 4CO
  HCl source: Recycled from anorthite leaching or other chlorine processes
  FFC Cambridge electrolyte:
    - Molten CaCl2 bath at 900-1100°C
    - Losses from cathode porosity and handling (~10%)
    - This process replenishes lost electrolyte
  Stoichiometry: CaO (56g) + 2HCl (73g) → CaCl2 (111g) + H2O (18g)
  Mass fractions: 198% CaCl2 from CaO input
  Advantages: Simple exothermic reaction
  Utilizes waste CaO from preprocessing
  Replenishes critical FFC electrolyte
  HCl recycled (not consumed overall)
  Disadvantages: Highly exothermic (requires careful control)
  Drying step needed for anhydrous salt
  Lunar context: CaO abundant from anorthite (70-95% of highlands)
  Critical for maintaining FFC operations
  Closes calcium-chlorine loop:
    CaAl2Si2O8 → CaO → CaCl2 (FFC) → repeat
  Alternative use: Desiccant, road de-icing (Earth), dust control
  Heat of reaction can be recovered for other processes
  Essential process for FFC Cambridge sustainability
