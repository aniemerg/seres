  Aluminosilicate glass production from lunar mineral oxides.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, FFC-process-for-deep-ISRU.txt
  Composition: 57% SiO2, 20% Al2O3, 12% MgO, 5% CaO, 6% FeO
  Melting point: 1100-1350°C (significantly lower than pure fused silica at 1710°C)
  Purpose: Structural glass for habitats, greenhouses, and general applications
  Lower melting point than pure silica saves energy
  Process details:
    1. Gather oxide components from mineral processing:
       - SiO2: From anorthite leaching or direct silica extraction
       - Al2O3: From anorthite leaching + HCl calcination
       - MgO: From olivine processing or FFC by-product
       - CaO: From anorthite processing or lime extraction
       - FeO: From ilmenite reduction or iron oxidation (optional for color)
    2. Mix oxides in correct proportions
    3. Load into glass melting furnace (crucible or tank furnace)
    4. Heat to 1100-1350°C (above liquidus temperature)
    5. Maintain molten state for homogenization (1-3 hours)
    6. Stir or bubble to ensure uniform composition
    7. Form glass: Pour, cast, blow, or draw into desired shape
    8. Anneal: Slow cooling to relieve thermal stress (400-600°C)
    9. Final cooling to room temperature
  Products:
    - Aluminosilicate glass: Transparent to translucent, greenish tint from FeO
    - Volatiles: Minor losses from evaporation
  Composition details:
    - SiO2 (57%): Network former, provides structure
    - Al2O3 (20%): Improves durability, chemical resistance
    - MgO (12%): Flux, reduces melting point
    - CaO (5%): Flux, improves workability
    - FeO (6%): Natural lunar component, causes green/brown color
  Glass properties:
    - Melting point: 1100-1350°C (depends on exact composition)
    - Density: ~2.5-2.7 g/cm³
    - Thermal expansion: Moderate (lower than soda-lime glass)
    - Chemical resistance: Excellent (aluminosilicate glasses durable)
    - Optical: Transparent but with greenish tint from FeO
  Iron content and color:
    - Natural lunar glass contains FeO (reduces from Fe2O3 in vacuum melting)
    - FeO gives green to brown coloration
    - For transparent colorless glass: Must remove iron impurities
    - For colored glass: Can adjust FeO content deliberately
  Decolorization (if needed):
    - Oxidize FeO to Fe2O3 (amber color, less intense)
    - Add MnO2 (complementary color, visual cancellation)
    - Or purify feedstock to remove all iron
  Applications:
    - Habitat windows: Structural glazing, pressure barriers
    - Greenhouse covers: Transmit light for plant growth
    - Containers: Chemical-resistant glassware
    - Fiber optics: Draw into fibers (if purified)
    - Insulation: Spin into glass wool
    - Radiation shielding: High-density glass with heavy elements
  Advantages: Lower melting point than pure silica (saves energy)
    Uses natural lunar mineral ratios (close to anorthite composition)
    No exotic additives required
    Durable and chemically resistant
    Can be formed by standard glass-working techniques
  Disadvantages: Natural FeO content darkens glass
    Not suitable for precision optics (unless purified)
    Requires multiple oxide inputs (logistical complexity)
    Thermal shock sensitivity (needs careful annealing)
  Comparison to fused silica:
    - Fused silica: 100% SiO2, melts at 1710°C, ultra-pure, expensive
    - Aluminosilicate: Mixed oxides, melts at 1100-1350°C, natural, economical
    - Fused silica for optics, aluminosilicate for structural
  Comparison to soda-lime glass (Earth):
    - Soda-lime: 70% SiO2, 15% Na2O, 10% CaO, melts at 1000°C
    - Aluminosilicate: No Na2O (sodium scarce on Moon)
    - Higher Al2O3 content improves durability
  Lunar context: Natural composition close to anorthite mineral
    Anorthite: CaAl2Si2O8 (decomposed to oxides)
    Add MgO from olivine, FeO from ilmenite
    Enables large-scale glass production from local resources
  Glass forming techniques:
    - Casting: Pour into molds (flat sheets, blocks)
    - Blowing: Traditional glassblowing for complex shapes
    - Drawing: Pull fibers or rods from molten glass
    - Float process: Flat glass on molten tin bath (high quality)
    - Pressing: Mold under pressure (optical elements)
  Annealing importance:
    - Glass cools unevenly → internal stress
    - Stress causes spontaneous fracture
    - Anneal at ~500°C (below glass transition)
    - Slow cool over hours to relieve stress
  Thermal properties:
    - Coefficient of thermal expansion: ~5-7 × 10⁻⁶ /°C
    - Glass transition temperature: ~600-700°C
    - Softening point: ~800-900°C
    - Working range: 1000-1200°C
  Chemical durability:
    - Excellent resistance to water, acids (except HF)
    - Aluminosilicate glasses very durable
    - Suitable for long-term lunar environment
  Optical properties:
    - Refractive index: ~1.52-1.55
    - Transmittance: 80-90% (visible), reduced by FeO
    - Absorption edge: UV region (glass blocks UV)
  Radiation resistance:
    - Glass darkens under ionizing radiation (color centers)
    - Aluminosilicate glasses more resistant than soda-lime
    - Can self-anneal under solar heating
  Recycling:
    - Glass fully recyclable (remelt and reform)
    - No chemical degradation from multiple cycles
    - Broken glass (cullet) used as feedstock
  Compositional flexibility:
    - Can adjust ratios for specific properties
    - More SiO2: Higher melting point, harder, more brittle
    - More MgO/CaO: Lower melting point, easier working
    - More Al2O3: Higher durability, chemical resistance
  Advanced variants:
    - Borosilicate: Add B2O3 for thermal shock resistance (Pyrex-like)
    - Lead glass: Add PbO for high refractive index (optics)
    - But exotic additives may not be available initially
  Scale-up potential:
    - Glass production highly scalable
    - Continuous tank furnaces for large-scale production
    - Can produce tons per day with proper infrastructure
