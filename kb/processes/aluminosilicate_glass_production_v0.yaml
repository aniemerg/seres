notes: "Aluminosilicate glass production from lunar mineral oxides.\nSource: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt,\
  \ FFC-process-for-deep-ISRU.txt\nComposition: 57% SiO2, 20% Al2O3, 12% MgO, 5% CaO,\
  \ 6% FeO\nMelting point: 1100-1350°C (significantly lower than pure fused silica\
  \ at 1710°C)\nPurpose: Structural glass for habitats, greenhouses, and general applications\n\
  Lower melting point than pure silica saves energy\nProcess details:\n  1. Gather\
  \ oxide components from mineral processing:\n     - SiO2: From anorthite leaching\
  \ or direct silica extraction\n     - Al2O3: From anorthite leaching + HCl calcination\n\
  \     - MgO: From olivine processing or FFC by-product\n     - CaO: From anorthite\
  \ processing or lime extraction\n     - FeO: From ilmenite reduction or iron oxidation\
  \ (optional for color)\n  2. Mix oxides in correct proportions\n  3. Load into glass\
  \ melting furnace (crucible_refractory or tank furnace)\n  4. Heat to 1100-1350°C\
  \ (above liquidus temperature)\n  5. Maintain molten state for homogenization (1-3\
  \ hours)\n  6. Stir or bubble to ensure uniform composition\n  7. Form glass: Pour,\
  \ cast, blow, or draw into desired shape\n  8. Anneal: Slow cooling to relieve thermal\
  \ stress (400-600°C)\n  9. Final cooling to room temperature\nProducts:\n  - Aluminosilicate\
  \ glass: Transparent to translucent, greenish tint from FeO\n  - Volatiles: Minor\
  \ losses from evaporation\nComposition details:\n  - SiO2 (57%): Network former,\
  \ provides structure\n  - Al2O3 (20%): Improves durability, chemical resistance\n\
  \  - MgO (12%): Flux, reduces melting point\n  - CaO (5%): Flux, improves workability\n\
  \  - FeO (6%): Natural lunar component, causes green/brown color\nGlass properties:\n\
  \  - Melting point: 1100-1350°C (depends on exact composition)\n  - Density: ~2.5-2.7\
  \ g/cm³\n  - Thermal expansion: Moderate (lower than soda-lime glass)\n  - Chemical\
  \ resistance: Excellent (aluminosilicate glasses durable)\n  - Optical: Transparent\
  \ but with greenish tint from FeO\nIron content and color:\n  - Natural lunar glass\
  \ contains FeO (reduces from Fe2O3 in vacuum melting)\n  - FeO gives green to brown\
  \ coloration\n  - For transparent colorless glass: Must remove iron impurities\n\
  \  - For colored glass: Can adjust FeO content deliberately\nDecolorization (if\
  \ needed):\n  - Oxidize FeO to Fe2O3 (amber color, less intense)\n  - Add MnO2 (complementary\
  \ color, visual cancellation)\n  - Or purify feedstock to remove all iron\nApplications:\n\
  \  - Habitat windows: Structural glazing, pressure barriers\n  - Greenhouse covers:\
  \ Transmit light for plant growth\n  - Containers: Chemical-resistant glassware\n\
  \  - Fiber optics: Draw into fibers (if purified)\n  - Insulation: Spin into glass\
  \ wool\n  - Radiation shielding: High-density glass with heavy elements\nAdvantages:\
  \ Lower melting point than pure silica (saves energy)\n  Uses natural lunar mineral\
  \ ratios (close to anorthite composition)\n  No exotic additives required\n  Durable\
  \ and chemically resistant\n  Can be formed by standard glass-working techniques\n\
  Disadvantages: Natural FeO content darkens glass\n  Not suitable for precision optics\
  \ (unless purified)\n  Requires multiple oxide inputs (logistical complexity)\n\
  \  Thermal shock sensitivity (needs careful annealing)\nComparison to fused silica:\n\
  \  - Fused silica: 100% SiO2, melts at 1710°C, ultra-pure, expensive\n  - Aluminosilicate:\
  \ Mixed oxides, melts at 1100-1350°C, natural, economical\n  - Fused silica for\
  \ optics, aluminosilicate for structural\nComparison to soda-lime glass (Earth):\n\
  \  - Soda-lime: 70% SiO2, 15% Na2O, 10% CaO, melts at 1000°C\n  - Aluminosilicate:\
  \ No Na2O (sodium scarce on Moon)\n  - Higher Al2O3 content improves durability\n\
  Lunar context: Natural composition close to anorthite mineral\n  Anorthite: CaAl2Si2O8\
  \ (decomposed to oxides)\n  Add MgO from olivine, FeO from ilmenite\n  Enables large-scale\
  \ glass production from local resources\nGlass forming techniques:\n  - Casting:\
  \ Pour into molds (flat sheets, blocks)\n  - Blowing: Traditional glassblowing for\
  \ complex shapes\n  - Drawing: Pull fibers or rods from molten glass\n  - Float\
  \ process: Flat glass on molten tin bath (high quality)\n  - Pressing: Mold under\
  \ pressure (optical elements)\nAnnealing importance:\n  - Glass cools unevenly →\
  \ internal stress\n  - Stress causes spontaneous fracture\n  - Anneal at ~500°C\
  \ (below glass transition)\n  - Slow cool over hours to relieve stress\nThermal\
  \ properties:\n  - Coefficient of thermal expansion: ~5-7 × 10⁻⁶ /°C\n  - Glass\
  \ transition temperature: ~600-700°C\n  - Softening point: ~800-900°C\n  - Working\
  \ range: 1000-1200°C\nChemical durability:\n  - Excellent resistance to water, acids\
  \ (except HF)\n  - Aluminosilicate glasses very durable\n  - Suitable for long-term\
  \ lunar environment\nOptical properties:\n  - Refractive index: ~1.52-1.55\n  -\
  \ Transmittance: 80-90% (visible), reduced by FeO\n  - Absorption edge: UV region\
  \ (glass blocks UV)\nRadiation resistance:\n  - Glass darkens under ionizing radiation\
  \ (color centers)\n  - Aluminosilicate glasses more resistant than soda-lime\n \
  \ - Can self-anneal under solar heating\nRecycling:\n  - Glass fully recyclable\
  \ (remelt and reform)\n  - No chemical degradation from multiple cycles\n  - Broken\
  \ glass (cullet) used as feedstock\nCompositional flexibility:\n  - Can adjust ratios\
  \ for specific properties\n  - More SiO2: Higher melting point, harder, more brittle\n\
  \  - More MgO/CaO: Lower melting point, easier working\n  - More Al2O3: Higher durability,\
  \ chemical resistance\nAdvanced variants:\n  - Borosilicate: Add B2O3 for thermal\
  \ shock resistance (Pyrex-like)\n  - Lead glass: Add PbO for high refractive index\
  \ (optics)\n  - But exotic additives may not be available initially\nScale-up potential:\n\
  \  - Glass production highly scalable\n  - Continuous tank furnaces for large-scale\
  \ production\n  - Can produce tons per day with proper infrastructure\n"
