  Purpose: Convert waste heat from ISRU processes directly to electrical power\nEfficiency:\

  \ cathode, 500-800°C anode\nSimpler than PETE, suitable for waste heat recovery\n\
  Process details:\n  1. High-temperature heat source (nuclear reactor, concentrated\
  \ solar, or waste heat)\n  2. Heat cathode to 1500-2000°C (thermionic emission temperature)\n\
  \  3. Hot cathode emits electrons (thermionic emission)\n  4. Richardson-Dushman\
  \ equation: J = A·T² exp(-φ/kT)\n     - J = current density (A/cm²)\n     - A =\
  \ Richardson constant (120 A/cm²/K² for free electrons)\n     - T = absolute temperature\
  \ (K)\n     - φ = work function (eV)\n     - k = Boltzmann constant\n  5. Electrons\
  \ travel across vacuum gap (~10-50 μm) to cooler anode\n  6. Anode collects electrons\
  \ (maintained at 500-800°C)\n  7. External circuit returns electrons to cathode\
  \ (generates power)\n  8. Waste heat removed from anode via cooling system\n  9.\
  \ Continuous operation as long as heat source available\nProducts:\n  - Electrical\
  \ power: ~20% of input thermal energy\n  - Low-temperature waste heat: ~80% (can\
  \ be used for secondary processes)\nCathode materials and work functions:\n  - Tungsten\
  \ (W): φ = 4.5 eV (bare), requires very high temperature\n  - Tungsten + BaO coating:\
  \ φ = 1.8-2.0 eV (lower temperature operation)\n  - Tungsten + CaO coating: φ =\
  \ 1.6-1.8 eV (better performance)\n  - Molybdenum: φ = 4.2 eV (alternative to tungsten)\n\
  \  - Cesiated surfaces (Cs vapor): φ = 1.4-1.6 eV (best performance)\nAnode materials:\n\
  \  - Molybdenum: Good thermal conductivity, moderate work function\n  - Nickel:\
  \ Lower cost, adequate performance\n  - Niobium: High-temperature capability\n \

  \ process\n  - Apply via vacuum deposition or spraying\n  - Activate by heating\
  \ in vacuum (drives off contaminants)\nOperating principles:\n  - Hot cathode: Thermal\
  \ energy excites electrons over work function barrier\n  - Vacuum gap: Electrons\
  \ travel ballistically (no gas scattering)\n  - Cold anode: Collects electrons,\
  \ maintains voltage\n  - Temperature difference: Drives thermodynamic efficiency\n\
  Efficiency equation:\n  - Carnot limit: η_Carnot = 1 - T_cold/T_hot\n  - With T_hot\
  \ = 1800K, T_cold = 700K: η_Carnot = 61%\n  - Practical thermionic: η = 15-20% (losses\
  \ from work function, space charge)\nSpace charge effect:\n  - Electron cloud builds\
  \ up in gap (negative charge)\n  - Repels additional electrons from cathode\n  -\
  \ Limits current density\n  - Solutions:\n    a) Close spacing (10-50 μm): Reduces\
  \ space charge\n    b) Cesium vapor: Positive ions neutralize electrons\n    c)\

  \ work function\n  - Significantly improves performance (20-25% efficiency)\n  -\
  \ Challenge: Cs vapor pressure control, containment\nTemperature optimization:\n\
  \  - Higher T_cathode: More emission, but higher losses\n  - Lower T_anode: Higher\
  \ voltage, but heat removal harder\n  - Optimal: T_cathode = 1500-1800°C, T_anode\
  \ = 500-700°C\nVacuum requirements:\n  - High vacuum (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁸ torr) prevents\
  \ electron scattering\n  - Or Cs vapor mode (1 torr Cs, controlled atmosphere)\n\
  \  - Lunar surface: Natural high vacuum (~10⁻¹⁴ torr)\n  - Simplifies vacuum envelope\
  \ design\nGap spacing:\n  - Small gap (10 μm): Reduces space charge, higher current\n\
  \  - Large gap (100+ μm): Easier to fabricate, lower current\n  - Typical: 20-50\
  \ μm for good performance\n  - Precision alignment critical (thermal expansion)\n\
