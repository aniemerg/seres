  Basic thermionic converter for direct heat-to-electricity conversion.
  Source: ellery-et-al-2022-metalysis-fray-farthing-chen-process, Power-on-the-Moon-using-ISRU.txt
  Purpose: Convert waste heat from ISRU processes directly to electrical power
  Efficiency: 15-20% typical (Russian nuclear reactors achieved 20%)
  Temperature: 1500-2000°C cathode, 500-800°C anode
  Simpler than PETE, suitable for waste heat recovery
  Process details:
    1. High-temperature heat source (nuclear reactor, concentrated solar, or waste heat)
    2. Heat cathode to 1500-2000°C (thermionic emission temperature)
    3. Hot cathode emits electrons (thermionic emission)
    4. Richardson-Dushman equation: J = A·T² exp(-φ/kT)
       - J = current density (A/cm²)
       - A = Richardson constant (120 A/cm²/K² for free electrons)
       - T = absolute temperature (K)
       - φ = work function (eV)
       - k = Boltzmann constant
    5. Electrons travel across vacuum gap (~10-50 μm) to cooler anode
    6. Anode collects electrons (maintained at 500-800°C)
    7. External circuit returns electrons to cathode (generates power)
    8. Waste heat removed from anode via cooling system
    9. Continuous operation as long as heat source available
  Products:
    - Electrical power: ~20% of input thermal energy
    - Low-temperature waste heat: ~80% (can be used for secondary processes)
  Cathode materials and work functions:
    - Tungsten (W): φ = 4.5 eV (bare), requires very high temperature
    - Tungsten + BaO coating: φ = 1.8-2.0 eV (lower temperature operation)
    - Tungsten + CaO coating: φ = 1.6-1.8 eV (better performance)
    - Molybdenum: φ = 4.2 eV (alternative to tungsten)
    - Cesiated surfaces (Cs vapor): φ = 1.4-1.6 eV (best performance)
  Anode materials:
    - Molybdenum: Good thermal conductivity, moderate work function
    - Nickel: Lower cost, adequate performance
    - Niobium: High-temperature capability
    - Work function less critical (electron collector)
  Cathode coating production (lunar):
    - BaO: From barium_oxide_extraction_v0 process
    - CaO: From calcium_oxide_extraction_v0 process
    - Apply via vacuum deposition or spraying
    - Activate by heating in vacuum (drives off contaminants)
  Operating principles:
    - Hot cathode: Thermal energy excites electrons over work function barrier
    - Vacuum gap: Electrons travel ballistically (no gas scattering)
    - Cold anode: Collects electrons, maintains voltage
    - Temperature difference: Drives thermodynamic efficiency
  Efficiency equation:
    - Carnot limit: η_Carnot = 1 - T_cold/T_hot
    - With T_hot = 1800K, T_cold = 700K: η_Carnot = 61%
    - Practical thermionic: η = 15-20% (losses from work function, space charge)
  Space charge effect:
    - Electron cloud builds up in gap (negative charge)
    - Repels additional electrons from cathode
    - Limits current density
    - Solutions:
      a) Close spacing (10-50 μm): Reduces space charge
      b) Cesium vapor: Positive ions neutralize electrons
      c) Magnetic field: Focuses electron beam
  Cesium vapor mode (advanced):
    - Add Cs vapor to gap at low pressure (~1 torr)
    - Cs ionizes: Cs → Cs⁺ + e⁻
    - Cs⁺ ions neutralize electron space charge
    - Cs adsorbs on surfaces: Lowers work function
    - Significantly improves performance (20-25% efficiency)
    - Challenge: Cs vapor pressure control, containment
  Temperature optimization:
    - Higher T_cathode: More emission, but higher losses
    - Lower T_anode: Higher voltage, but heat removal harder
    - Optimal: T_cathode = 1500-1800°C, T_anode = 500-700°C
  Vacuum requirements:
    - High vacuum (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁸ torr) prevents electron scattering
    - Or Cs vapor mode (1 torr Cs, controlled atmosphere)
    - Lunar surface: Natural high vacuum (~10⁻¹⁴ torr)
    - Simplifies vacuum envelope design
  Gap spacing:
    - Small gap (10 μm): Reduces space charge, higher current
    - Large gap (100+ μm): Easier to fabricate, lower current
    - Typical: 20-50 μm for good performance
    - Precision alignment critical (thermal expansion)
  Heat source options (lunar):
    - Nuclear reactor: Continuous high-temperature heat (fission)
    - Concentrated solar: Daytime operation only (heliostats, lenses)
    - Waste heat from FFC Cambridge: 900-1100°C (boost to 1500°C)
    - Waste heat from smelting: High-temperature industrial processes
  Advantages: Direct conversion (no moving parts, no wear)
    Long lifetime (solid-state, no mechanical degradation)
    Compact and lightweight
    Silent operation
    Can use waste heat from ISRU processes
    Proven technology (Russian nuclear reactors, 1960s-1980s)
  Disadvantages: Lower efficiency than PETE (20% vs 40-50%)
    Requires very high temperatures (1500-2000°C)
    Work function limits voltage output (~1-2V typical)
    Space charge limits current (unless mitigated)
    Materials challenges (high-temperature operation)
  Lunar context: Abundant heat sources (solar, nuclear, ISRU waste heat)
    Natural high vacuum (simplifies design)
    Tungsten from meteorites (cathode material)
    BaO, CaO available from mineral processing
    Ideal for coupling with thermal ISRU processes

    - Coating depletion: BaO, CaO sublimate over time
    - Interdiffusion: Materials mix at high temperatures
    - Mitigation: Excess coating thickness, periodic renewal
  Lifetime:

  Integration with ISRU:
    - FFC Cambridge: 900-1100°C waste heat → boost to 1500°C → thermionic
    - Glass melting: 1400-1600°C furnace → thermionic on furnace walls
    - Smelting: 1500-2000°C operations → direct thermionic conversion
    - Net: Electrical power + useful heat for processes
  Energy cascade (example):
    1. Concentrated solar → 2000°C
    2. Thermionic converter: 2000°C → 800°C, generate 20% electricity
    3. Waste heat (800°C) → FFC Cambridge (900°C with heat pump)
    4. FFC waste heat (700°C) → secondary processes
    5. Overall system efficiency: >60% useful energy
  Power output scaling (example):
    - 100 kW thermal input
    - 20% efficiency → 20 kW electrical output
    - 80 kW waste heat at 700°C (reusable)
    - For 1 MW electrical: 5 MW thermal input required
  Lunar deployment scenarios:
