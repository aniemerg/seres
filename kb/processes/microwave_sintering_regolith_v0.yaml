  notes: Microwave heating couples efficiently with nanophase iron in regolith. Reaches
    1000-1500°C with rapid heating (1000°C/min). More energy-efficient than conventional
    sintering due to volumetric heating and strong coupling with iron particles.

  notes: 'Very rapid process due to efficient microwave coupling. 1000°C/min heating
    rate possible. Typical cycle: mold filling, microwave exposure (minutes), cooling.
    Can be performed in-situ with mobile microwave head on rover.'

  Microwave sintering process for consolidating lunar regolith into solid construction blocks or in-situ structures.
  Exploits the ubiquitous nanophase iron (np-Fe0) in lunar regolith which couples strongly with microwave radiation at 2.45 GHz.

  Process characteristics:
  - Operating temperature: 1000-1500°C (typically 1200°C, just below regolith melting point)
  - Heating rate: Up to 1000°C/min due to excellent microwave coupling
  - Compressive strength: 55 MPa achieved for microwave-sintered regolith bricks
  - Stronger binding than solar sintering methods
  - Can be performed in-situ using mobile microwave applicator head mounted on rover
  - Typical microwave frequency: 2.45 GHz
  - Power requirement: 100-350W (specification for equipment design)

  Applications:
  - Construction bricks and blocks
  - Landing pad surfacing (in-situ sintering)
  - Road/walkway paving
  - Protective shells and structures
  - Foundation pads for equipment
