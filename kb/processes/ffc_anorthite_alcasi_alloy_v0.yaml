  Direct FFC Cambridge reduction of anorthite to produce AlCaSi mongrel alloy.
  Source: FFC-process-for-deep-ISRU.txt, ellery-et-al-2022-metalysis
  Reaction: CaAl2Si2O8 → AlCaSi alloy + O2 (via electrolysis in CaCl2)
  Temperature: 900-1100°C (molten CaCl2 electrolyte)
  Voltage: 2.5-3V typical
  Process: Direct electrolytic reduction without preprocessing
  Purpose: Simple one-step alloy production from abundant anorthite
  Highland regolith is 70-95% anorthite-rich anorthosite
  Structural material and specialty applications
  Process details:
    1. Anorthite ore (CaAl2Si2O8) from highland regolith
    2. Powder, compact, and sinter into cathode form
    3. Immerse in molten CaCl2 electrolyte at 900-1100°C
    4. Apply voltage (graphite anode)
    5. AlCaSi alloy forms as porous metallic sponge
    6. Oxygen released at anode (with C → CO/CO2)
    7. Remove alloy sponge, densify or remelt
  Products:
    - AlCaSi alloy: Aluminum-calcium-silicon mongrel alloy
    - O2 (oxygen): Valuable by-product (46% by mass!)
  Alloy composition (theoretical from CaAl2Si2O8):
    - Al: 19.4% by mass (from Al2O3 component)
    - Ca: 14.4% (from CaO component)
    - Si: 20.2% (from 2 SiO2 components)
    - Total metal: 54.0% of anorthite mass
  Actual alloy properties: NEED INVESTIGATION
    - AlSi alloys are well-known (silumin: casting alloys)
    - AlCa: Less common, Ca additions improve castability
    - AlCaSi: Ternary alloy, properties not well-characterized
  Potential applications:
    - Casting alloy: AlSi (20-50% Si) used for high-fluidity castings
    - Brazing filler metal: AlSi used for joining aluminum parts
    - Structural material: Moderate strength, low density
    - Wear-resistant surfaces: Si precipitates provide hardness
  AlSi alloy benefits (from terrestrial use):
    - Lower viscosity than pure Al (better casting)
    - Low thermal expansion
    - Good wear resistance (Si particles)
    - Etching can create porous Si for oil retention (engine applications)
  Stoichiometry: CaAl2Si2O8 (278.2g) → Ca (40.1g) + 2Al (54g) + 2Si (56.2g) + 4 O2 (128g)
  Total metals: 150.3g (54.0%), oxygen: 46.0%
  Advantages: Single-step process from most abundant lunar mineral
    Anorthite is 70-95% of highlands (vast resource)
    Very high oxygen yield (46% by mass!)
    No preprocessing required
    Potentially useful alloy properties
  Disadvantages: "Mongrel" composition not precisely controlled
    Ca inclusion may or may not be beneficial
    Properties unknown - requires testing
    Not suitable for applications requiring pure Al or Si
  Comparison to pure metal routes:
    - Pure: CaAl2Si2O8 + 4C → CaO + Al2O3 + 2Si (carbothermal), then separate
    - Or: HCl leaching → CaCl2 + Al2O3 + SiO2, then FFC each separately
    - Mongrel: Direct FFC (simplest but least controlled)
  Lunar context: Anorthite THE most abundant highland mineral
    This route exploits highlands abundance directly
    Suitable for bulk structural material
    Trade simplicity for material property uncertainty
  Oxygen yield exceptional: 46% by mass from anorthite!
    Higher than any other lunar mineral process
    Critical for life support and propellant
  Iron contamination tolerance:
    - Highland anorthite has low Fe (<1%)
    - Can add Ni, Co from meteorite sources to strengthen
  Next steps: Metallurgical characterization of AlCaSi alloy
    Tensile strength, hardness, corrosion resistance
    Casting properties, weldability
    May be suitable for many applications as-is
    Or further processing to separate components
