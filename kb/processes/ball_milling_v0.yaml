notes: "Ball milling process for grinding and mixing powders. Rotating cylinder with grinding media (steel or ceramic balls) reduces particle size and creates uniform mixtures. Used for ceramic powders, metal powders, and mineral processing. Milling time varies by desired fineness (2-24 hours). Small mass loss (~2%) due to media wear and powder handling."
