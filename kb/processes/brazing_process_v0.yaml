  Brazing process for joining metals with filler alloy above 450°C.
  Source: Referenced by cooling_water_jacket_v0 and other recipes
  Principle: Capillary action draws molten filler between close-fitting parts
  Temperature: 600-1200°C typical depending on alloy
  Common alloys:
    - Copper-phosphorus (self-fluxing for copper)
    - Silver-copper-zinc (general purpose)
    - Nickel-based (high temperature, corrosion resistant)
  Advantages over welding: Lower temperature, joins dissimilar metals, less distortion
  Applications: Heat exchangers, fittings, carbide tool tips, electronic assemblies
  Atmosphere: Inert gas, vacuum, or with flux to prevent oxidation
  Joint strength: Typically as strong as base metal
  Critical for: Leak-tight joints, dissimilar metal joining, precision assemblies
