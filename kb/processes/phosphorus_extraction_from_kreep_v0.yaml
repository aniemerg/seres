  Extraction of elemental phosphorus from apatite (calcium phosphate) in KREEP regions.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, Power-on-the-Moon-using-ISRU.txt
  Reaction: 4H3PO4 + 16C → P4 + 6H2 + 16CO (simplified from Ca3(PO4)2)
  Or: Ca3(PO4)2 + 5C → 3CaO + 2P + 5CO (then P4 formation)
  Temperature: 850°C (phosphorus vaporizes)
  Process: Carbothermal reduction in sealed retort
  Purpose: Extract phosphorus from KREEP minerals
  Essential element for life support (agriculture)
  Electronic materials (phosphorus doping)
  Process details:
    1. Apatite [Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH)] from KREEP basalts
    2. Mix with carbon (reducing agent)
    3. Heat to 850°C in sealed retort (excludes oxygen)
    4. Phosphorus vaporizes as P4 molecules
    5. Condense phosphorus vapor underwater (safety)
    6. Store as white phosphorus under water
    7. CaO (quicklime) remains as solid residue
  Products:
    - P4 (white phosphorus): Highly reactive, toxic, pyrophoric
    - H2 (hydrogen): By-product gas
    - CO (carbon monoxide): Recyclable
    - CaO (calcium oxide): Useful for various processes
  KREEP regions:
    - Oceanus Procellarum and Imbrium Basin (northwest nearside)
    - Enriched in K (potassium), REE (rare earth elements), P (phosphorus)
    - P concentration: ~2× terrestrial soil (still depleted overall)
    - Apatite: Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH) - primary P mineral
    - Concentrated enough for economic extraction
  White phosphorus handling:
    - Extremely pyrophoric (ignites in air at 34°C)
    - Toxic (lethal dose ~50 mg)
    - Stored underwater to prevent air contact
    - Converted to red phosphorus (safer allotrope) by heating to 250°C
  Phosphorus applications:
    - Agriculture: Phosphate fertilizers (critical for food production)
    - Life support: Plant growth in habitats
    - Electronics: Phosphorus doping (n-type semiconductor)
    - Chemical synthesis: Phosphoric acid, phosphates
    - Incendiaries/pyrotechnics (white P)
  Stoichiometry: Ca3(PO4)2 (310g) + 5C (60g) → 3CaO (168g) + 2P (62g) + 5CO (140g)
  Mass fractions: 24.7% P, 89.0% CaO, 141% CO from apatite
  Red phosphorus production: Heat white P to 250°C in sealed vessel
    - Much safer (not pyrophoric)
    - Less reactive
    - Preferred form for most applications
  Advantages: Only viable source of phosphorus on Moon
  KREEP localized and accessible
  CaO by-product useful
  CO recyclable
  Disadvantages: High toxicity and reactivity of white P
  KREEP only in specific regions (not globally distributed)
  High temperature requirement
  Safety hazards in handling
  Lunar context: Phosphorus absolutely essential for agriculture
  Long-term settlement requires food production
  No alternative source on Moon
  Must extract from KREEP despite challenges
  Careful handling protocols essential
  Red phosphorus conversion recommended immediately
