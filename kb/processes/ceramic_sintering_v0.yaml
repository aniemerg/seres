  notes: "extended heating cycle with controlled ramp, soak, and cooling for sintering and densification"
notes: Sintering process to densify ceramic parts by heating below melting point. Atomic diffusion bonds particles together, reducing porosity and increasing strength. Used for technical ceramics, insulators, and refractory components.
