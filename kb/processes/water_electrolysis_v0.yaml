  Water electrolysis for producing hydrogen and oxygen gases.
  Source: All ISRU papers (fundamental process)
  Reaction: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2
  Voltage: 1.23V minimum (thermodynamic), 1.8-2.4V typical (with overpotential)
  Current density: 0.5-2 A/cm² typical
  Purpose: Split water into constituent gases for propellant, life support, and chemical feedstock
  Process details:
    1. Pure water (or dilute electrolyte solution)
    2. DC electrical current through electrolyzer cell
    3. Cathode reaction: 4H2O + 4e⁻ → 2H2 + 4OH⁻
    4. Anode reaction: 4OH⁻ → O2 + 2H2O + 4e⁻
    5. Net: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2
    6. H2 collected at cathode, O2 at anode
    7. Gas separation and drying
  Products:
    - Hydrogen gas (H2): 11.1% by mass (stoichiometric)
    - Oxygen gas (O2): 88.9% by mass (stoichiometric)
  Stoichiometry: 2H2O (36g) → 2H2 (4g) + O2 (32g)
  Mass yields: 11.1% H2, 88.9% O2
  Volume ratio: 2:1 (H2:O2) at STP
  Electrolyte types:
    - Alkaline (KOH solution): Most common, mature technology
    - PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane): High purity, compact
    - Solid oxide (SOEC): High temperature, higher efficiency
  Alkaline electrolysis (most common):
    - Electrolyte: 25-30% KOH solution
    - Temperature: 60-80°C
    - Pressure: 1-30 bar
    - Efficiency: 60-70% (LHV basis)
  PEM electrolysis:
    - Membrane: Nafion or similar polymer
    - Temperature: 50-80°C
    - Pressure: Up to 200 bar (high-pressure H2)
    - Purity: 99.999% H2 (no KOH carryover)
    - Efficiency: 65-75%
  Solid oxide electrolysis (SOEC):
    - Temperature: 700-900°C
    - Uses waste heat from other processes
    - Efficiency: 85-90% (thermoneutral operation)
    - Less mature technology
  Energy requirements:
    - Theoretical minimum: 39.4 kWh/kg H2 (HHV basis)
    - Practical: 50-60 kWh/kg H2 (alkaline)
    - Per kg water: 4-5 kWh (typical)
  Applications:
    - Propellant: H2-O2 rocket fuel (high Isp ~450s)
    - Life support: O2 for breathing
    - Chemical feedstock: H2 for reduction reactions
    - Energy storage: H2 fuel cells for power generation
    - Sabatier/Bosch: H2 for CO2 reduction
  Lunar context: Critical process for ISRU
    - Water from polar ice or regolith volatiles
    - O2 for life support and oxidizer
    - H2 for propellant and chemical processing
    - Enables many downstream processes
  Advantages: Simple, well-established technology
    High-purity products (especially PEM)
    Scalable from small to large scale
    No chemical reagents consumed
  Disadvantages: Energy intensive
    Requires electrical power (solar/nuclear)
    Alkaline systems require KOH (Earth import initially)
    PEM membranes may be difficult to manufacture in-situ
  Lunar implementation considerations:
    - PEM preferred for high purity and compactness
    - Alkaline viable with KOH import or in-situ synthesis
    - SOEC attractive if waste heat available (FFC, smelting)
    - High-pressure operation reduces storage volume
  Gas purity and separation:
    - Membrane separators for final cleanup
    - H2 purity: 99.9-99.999% depending on electrolyzer type
    - O2 purity: 99.2-99.9%
    - Trace water removal via desiccant or PSA
  Hydrogen storage:
    - Compressed gas: 200-700 bar tanks
    - Cryogenic liquid: 20K (-253°C)
    - Metal hydrides: Mg, LaNi5 (reversible storage)
  Oxygen storage:
    - Compressed gas: 150-200 bar typical
    - Cryogenic liquid: 90K (-183°C)
    - Higher density as liquid (for propellant)
  Safety considerations:
    - H2-O2 mixture explosive (4-75% H2 in O2)
    - Must prevent gas mixing
    - Catalytic recombiners for trace H2 removal from O2
    - Proper venting in case of overpressure
  Efficiency improvements:
    - Advanced catalysts: IrO2 (anode), Pt (cathode) for PEM
    - Thinner membranes: Reduce resistance
    - Higher temperature: Improves kinetics (SOEC)
    - Pressurized operation: Direct high-pressure H2
  Integration opportunities:
    - Coupled with FFC Cambridge: O2 from both processes
    - Sabatier loop: Recycle H2 from water product
    - Fuel cells: Reverse process for power generation
    - Ilmenite reduction: H2 feedstock for reduction
