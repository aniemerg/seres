  Cryogenic separation of helium-3 from helium-4 for potential fusion fuel.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, FFC-process-for-deep-ISRU.txt
  Process: Extreme cryogenic fractional distillation
  Temperature: <4.2 K (near absolute zero, -269°C)
  3He concentration: 4-30 ppb in regolith (parts per billion)
  Purpose: Separate valuable 3He isotope for future nuclear fusion
  3He extraction released with other volatiles (thermal processing)
  Process details:
    1. Mixed He isotopes from regolith volatile extraction
    2. Cool to <4.2 K (He boiling point for 4He)
    3. Fractional distillation exploits boiling point difference:
       - 3He boiling point: 3.19 K
       - 4He boiling point: 4.22 K
       - ΔT = 1.03 K difference
    4. Multiple distillation stages for separation
    5. Collect 3He fraction (earlier to boil/condense)
    6. 4He remains as bulk fraction
    7. Store 3He in extreme cryogenic vessels (<4 K)
  Products:
    - 3He (helium-3): Potential nuclear fusion fuel
    - 4He (helium-4): Inert gas, leak detection, cryogenic applications
  3He concentration in regolith:
    - Average: 4 ppb (parts per billion)
    - High-Ti mare: Up to 10-30 ppb (mature regolith)
    - Mare Tranquillitatis, Oceanus Procellarum highest
    - Total lunar inventory: ~2 × 10⁸ kg (200 million kg)
  Collection requirements:
    - 40 m² at 1m depth → 1g 3He (plus 8.2 kg carbon)
    - 40 km² at 1m depth → 1 metric tonne 3He
    - Massive scale required for significant quantities
  3He nuclear fusion:
    - Reaction: D + 3He → 4He + p + 18.4 MeV (deuterium-helium-3)
    - Advantages: Aneutronic (no neutron radiation)
    - Less radioactive waste than D-T fusion
    - Disadvantages: Higher ignition temperature than D-T
    - D-T fusion not yet commercial, D-3He even further away
  Stoichiometry: 1 kg mixed He → 14 μg 3He, 999.986 mg 4He (at 14 ppb)
  At mature high-Ti mare (30 ppb): ~30 μg 3He per kg He
  4He applications:
    - Inert atmosphere for welding, crystal growth
    - Leak detection (small molecule, easily detected)
    - Cryogenic applications (superfluid helium)
    - Balloon/airship gas (Earth applications)
  Advantages: 3He extremely valuable for future fusion
    Released automatically with volatile extraction
    Separation technology well-established (terrestrial)
    4He by-product also useful
  Disadvantages: Extremely low concentration (ppb level)
    Requires cryogenic storage at <4 K (challenging)
    Nuclear fusion still not commercially viable
    D-3He fusion even more difficult than D-T
    Massive processing required for useful quantities
  Lunar context: 3He touted as "lunar resource" for future
    But fusion technology very far from reality
    Should 3He be husbanded for future generations?
    Or consumed/lost during volatile processing?
    Ethical question: Waste vs. extreme cryogenic storage
  Storage requirements: <4 K cryogenic for indefinite storage
    - Extreme energy cost for refrigeration
    - Boil-off losses without perfect insulation
    - May not be practical for long-term lunar storage
  Recommendation (per source papers): Capture and store if feasible
    But don't let 3He recovery block volatile extraction
    Volatiles (C, N, H) more immediately critical
    3He as bonus/future resource, not primary driver
