  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, FFC-process-for-deep-ISRU.txt\nProcess:\
  \ Extreme cryogenic fractional distillation\nTemperature: <4.2 K (near absolute\
  \ zero, -269°C)\n3He concentration: 4-30 ppb in regolith (parts per billion)\nPurpose:\
  \ Separate valuable 3He isotope for future nuclear fusion\n3He extraction released\
  \ with other volatiles (thermal processing)\nProcess details:\n  1. Mixed He isotopes\
  \ from regolith volatile extraction\n  2. Cool to <4.2 K (He boiling point for 4He)\n\
  \  3. Fractional distillation exploits boiling point difference:\n     - 3He boiling\
  \ point: 3.19 K\n     - 4He boiling point: 4.22 K\n     - ΔT = 1.03 K difference\n\
  \  4. Multiple distillation stages for separation\n  5. Collect 3He fraction (earlier\
  \ to boil/condense)\n  6. 4He remains as bulk fraction\n  7. Store 3He in extreme\
  \ cryogenic vessels (<4 K)\nProducts:\n  - 3He (helium-3): Potential nuclear fusion\
  \ fuel\n  - 4He (helium-4): Inert gas, leak detection, cryogenic applications\n\
  3He concentration in regolith:\n  - Average: 4 ppb (parts per billion)\n  - High-Ti\
  \ mare: Up to 10-30 ppb (mature regolith)\n  - Mare Tranquillitatis, Oceanus Procellarum\
  \ highest\n  - Total lunar inventory: ~2 × 10⁸ kg (200 million kg)\nCollection requirements:\n\
  \  - 40 m² at 1m depth → 1g 3He (plus 8.2 kg carbon)\n  - 40 km² at 1m depth → 1\
  \ metric tonne 3He\n  - Massive scale required for significant quantities\n3He nuclear\
  \ fusion:\n  - Reaction: D + 3He → 4He + p + 18.4 MeV (deuterium-helium-3)\n  -\
  \ Advantages: Aneutronic (no neutron radiation)\n  - Less radioactive waste than\
  \ D-T fusion\n  - Disadvantages: Higher ignition temperature than D-T\n  - D-T fusion\
  \ not yet commercial, D-3He even further away\nStoichiometry: 1 kg mixed He → 14\
  \ μg 3He, 999.986 mg 4He (at 14 ppb)\nAt mature high-Ti mare (30 ppb): ~30 μg 3He\
  \ per kg He\n4He applications:\n  - Inert atmosphere for welding, crystal growth\n\
  \  - Leak detection (small molecule, easily detected)\n  - Cryogenic applications\
  \ (superfluid helium)\n  - Balloon/airship gas (Earth applications)\nAdvantages:\
  \ 3He extremely valuable for future fusion\n  Released automatically with volatile\
  \ extraction\n  Separation technology well-established (terrestrial)\n  4He by-product\
  \ also useful\nDisadvantages: Extremely low concentration (ppb level)\n  Requires\
  \ cryogenic storage at <4 K (challenging)\n  Nuclear fusion still not commercially\
  \ viable\n  D-3He fusion even more difficult than D-T\n  Massive processing required\
  \ for useful quantities\nLunar context: 3He touted as \"lunar resource\" for future\n\
  \  But fusion technology very far from reality\n  Should 3He be husbanded for future\
  \ generations?\n  Or consumed/lost during volatile processing?\n  Ethical question:\
  \ Waste vs. extreme cryogenic storage\nStorage requirements: <4 K cryogenic for\
  \ indefinite storage\n  - Extreme energy cost for refrigeration\n  - Boil-off losses\
  \ without perfect insulation\n  - May not be practical for long-term lunar storage\n\
  Recommendation (per source papers): Capture and store if feasible\n  But don't let\
  \ 3He recovery block volatile extraction\n  Volatiles (C, N, H) more immediately\
  \ critical\n  3He as bonus/future resource, not primary driver\n"
