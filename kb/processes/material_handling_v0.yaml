notes: Material handling operations including loading, unloading, positioning, and
  transporting materials and parts within manufacturing facility. Methods include
  forklifts, cranes, conveyors, carts, and manual handling. Moves raw materials to
  processing stations, work-in-progress between operations, and finished goods to
  storage. Critical support operation for production flow. Minimal material loss (primarily
  from spillage prevention). Used in all manufacturing operations requiring material
  movement.
