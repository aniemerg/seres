  Ammonia recovery from ammonium chloride using quicklime (calcium oxide).
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, Lunar-Demandite.txt
  Reaction: 2NH4Cl + CaO → 2NH3 + CaCl2 + H2O
  Temperature: Moderate heating (100-200°C for ammonia evolution)
  Process: Acid-base reaction liberating ammonia gas
  Part of Solvay process recycling loop for sodium carbonate production
  Purpose: Recycle ammonia from Solvay process intermediate
  Nitrogen conservation (scarce lunar resource)
  Regenerate valuable NH3 for Haber-Bosch or other processes
  Process details:
    1. NH4Cl (ammonium chloride) from Solvay process
    2. React with CaO (quicklime from anorthite processing)
    3. NH3 evolved as gas, captured by distillation/condensation
    4. CaCl2 (calcium chloride) by-product
  Products:
    - NH3 (ammonia): Recycled to Haber-Bosch, Ostwald, or Solvay processes
    - CaCl2 (calcium chloride): FFC Cambridge electrolyte replenishment
    - H2O (water): Process water
  Calcium oxide source: Anorthite carbothermal reduction
  CaAl2Si2O8 + 4C → CaO + Al2O3 + 2Si + 4CO
  Stoichiometry: 2NH4Cl (107g) + CaO (56g) → 2NH3 (34g) + CaCl2 (111g) + H2O (18g)
  Mass fractions: 63.6% NH3, 208% CaCl2, 33.7% H2O from NH4Cl input
  Solvay process context:
    - Overall Solvay: 2NaCl + CaCO3 ⇌ Na2CO3 + CaCl2
    - Intermediate: NaCl + NH3 + CO2 + H2O → NaHCO3 + NH4Cl
    - This process recovers NH3 from NH4Cl
    - CO2 also recovered and recycled
  Advantages: Simple acid-base chemistry
  Complete ammonia recovery
  CaCl2 by-product valuable for FFC electrolyte
  CaO abundant from anorthite
  Disadvantages: Requires CaO input
  Additional processing step in Solvay loop
  Lunar applications: Critical for nitrogen conservation
  Ammonia too scarce to waste as NH4Cl
  Enables closed-loop Solvay process
  CaCl2 output supports FFC Cambridge operations
  Alternative route: CaCl2 + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + 2HCl (recovers HCl instead)
