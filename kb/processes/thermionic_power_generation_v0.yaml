  Converts concentrated solar thermal energy (1600-2700°C) directly into electrical power

  via thermionic emission in vacuum tube converters.


  OPERATING PRINCIPLE:

  - Concentrated sunlight heats tungsten cathode to emission temperature (~2000°C)

  - Cathode coated with CaO to reduce work function and enable lower operating temperature

  - Thermal energy causes thermionic emission - electrons "boil off" cathode surface

  - Electrons flow across vacuum gap to nickel anode, generating DC electrical current

  - No intermediate conversion steps (solar → thermal → electric directly)


  CONVERSION EFFICIENCY:

  - Primitive/v0 systems: ~10% solar-to-electric

  - Optimized systems (v1/v2): 15-20%

  - Theoretical maximum: 30%

  - Waste heat: 70-90% must be rejected via radiators


  ADVANTAGES OVER PHOTOVOLTAICS:

  - 100% manufacturable from lunar materials (anorthite + NiFe meteorites)

  - Higher efficiency than lunar PV (1-5% without dopants)

  - Proven technology (used in space nuclear reactors: 5-20% efficiency)

  - Dual-use concentrators (power + foundry operations)

  - Same vacuum tube technology as computing/communications


  MATERIALS (all lunar-sourced):

  - Cathode: Tungsten with CaO coating (from anorthite)

  - Anode: Nickel (from NiFe meteorites)

  - Envelope: Fused silica glass (from anorthite)

  - Concentrator: Cast glass Fresnel lenses or polished Ni mirrors


  ENERGY FLOW:

  Solar Irradiance → Concentrated Thermal (1600-2700°C) → Thermionic Emission

  → Electrical Power (10-30%) + Waste Heat (70-90%)
