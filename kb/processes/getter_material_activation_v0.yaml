  Process for activating getter materials for vacuum systems.
  Source: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0
  Purpose: Getters absorb residual gases in vacuum tubes and sealed systems
  Common getter materials:
    - Barium (most common): Activated by heating, absorbs O2, N2, H2O, CO2
    - Titanium: Flash getter, sublimes onto tube walls
    - Zirconium-aluminum alloys: Non-evaporable getters (NEG)
  Activation process: Heat getter to 800-1200°C in high vacuum
  Mechanism: Heating vaporizes or exposes fresh reactive surface
  Applications:
    - Vacuum tubes (maintain vacuum over lifetime)
    - Sealed vacuum systems
    - Photomultipliers
    - X-ray tubes
  Lunar context: Essential for vacuum tube electronics manufacturing
  Critical for: Vacuum tube longevity, sealed system reliability
