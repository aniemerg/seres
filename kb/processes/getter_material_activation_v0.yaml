notes: "Process for activating getter materials for vacuum systems.\nSource: docs/paper_reviews/paper_reviews_dec2024_comprehensive_v0\n\
  Purpose: Getters absorb residual gases in vacuum tubes and sealed systems\nCommon\
  \ getter materials:\n  - Barium (most common): Activated by heating, absorbs O2,\
  \ N2, H2O, CO2\n  - Titanium: Flash getter, sublimes onto tube walls\n  - Zirconium-aluminum\
  \ alloys: Non-evaporable getters (NEG)\nActivation process: Heat getter to 800-1200°C\
  \ in high vacuum\nMechanism: Heating vaporizes or exposes fresh reactive surface\n\
  Applications:\n  - Vacuum tubes (maintain vacuum over lifetime)\n  - Sealed vacuum\
  \ systems\n  - Photomultipliers\n  - X-ray tubes\nLunar context: Essential for vacuum\
  \ tube electronics manufacturing\nCritical for: Vacuum tube longevity, sealed system\
  \ reliability\n"
