notes: "KREEP basalt modeled as basalt_aggregate until a dedicated KREEP feedstock\
  \ exists.\nREE oxide concentrate modeled as reduced_metal_oxides for now.\nRare\
  \ earth element (REE) extraction from KREEP basalts (advanced process).\nSource:\
  \ Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt\nPurpose: Extract REE for permanent magnets (NdFeB),\
  \ superconductors (NbTi), catalysts\nKREEP: Potassium (K), Rare Earth Elements (REE),\
  \ Phosphorus (P) enriched basalts\nConcentration: ~1200 ppm average REE (0.12%),\
  \ up to 5× higher than Earth\nWARNING: Complex, energy-intensive process - not suitable\
  \ for first-generation ISRU\nProcess details:\n  1. Locate KREEP regions using gamma-ray\
  \ spectroscopy\n     - Detect U, Th signatures (correlate with REE)\n     - U/Th\
  \ ratio ~0.27 typical for KREEP\n     - Imbrium basin, Oceanus Procellarum highest\
  \ concentrations\n  2. Mine and crush KREEP basalt ore\n  3. Roast ore at 600°C\
  \ to oxidize Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺ (if Ce separation desired)\n  4. Acid leaching with concentrated\
  \ H2SO4 (or HCl)\n     - Heat to 80-100°C for several hours\n     - REE dissolve\
  \ as sulfates or chlorides\n     - REE³⁺ + 3/2 H2SO4 → REE2(SO4)3 + 3/2 H2\n  5.\
  \ Filter leach liquor from insoluble residue\n  6. Solvent extraction for REE concentration\
  \ and separation\n     - Organic extractants: D2EHPA, Cyanex, TODGA\n     - Multiple\
  \ stages for individual REE separation\n     - pH-dependent extraction selectivity\n\
  \  7. Strip REE from organic phase with acid\n  8. Precipitate REE as oxalates:\
  \ REE³⁺ + oxalic acid → REE2(C2O4)3\n  9. Calcinate oxalates to oxides: REE2(C2O4)3\
  \ → REE2O3 + CO + CO2\n  10. Further purification if individual REE needed (beyond\
  \ scope)\nProducts:\n  - Mixed rare earth oxides (REO): ~0.12% of ore mass, mixture\
  \ of La, Ce, Nd, Y, etc.\n  - Leach residue: Depleted ore, may contain valuable\
  \ minerals\n  - Acids: Partially recycled\nREE concentration in KREEP:\n  - Total\
  \ REE: ~1200 ppm (0.12%) average\n  - Y: ~300 ppm (most abundant)\n  - Ce: ~300\
  \ ppm\n  - Nd: ~180 ppm (critical for magnets)\n  - La: ~150 ppm\n  - Sm: ~50 ppm\n\
  \  - Gd: ~50 ppm\n  - Pr: ~40 ppm\n  - Dy: ~30 ppm (critical for magnets)\n  - Others:\
  \ Eu (~3-5 ppm), Tb, Ho, Er, Yb, Lu (each <30 ppm)\nKREEP detection:\n  - Gamma-ray\
  \ spectroscopy: Detect U (3-10 ppm), Th (10-40 ppm)\n  - U/Th ratio ~0.27 diagnostic\
  \ for KREEP\n  - Lunar Prospector gamma-ray data shows hotspots\n  - Procellarum\
  \ KREEP Terrane (PKT) richest region\nREE applications (critical for advanced technology):\n\
  \  - NdFeB magnets: Strongest permanent magnets (Nd, Dy additions)\n  - Electric\
  \ motors: High-power-density motors (robotics, spacecraft)\n  - Generators: Lightweight,\
  \ high-efficiency power generation\n  - Superconductors: NbTi superconducting wire\
  \ (Nb is REE-associated)\n  - Catalysts: La, Ce for various chemical processes\n\
  \  - Lasers: Nd:YAG lasers (Nd-doped yttrium aluminum garnet)\n  - Phosphors: Eu,\
  \ Tb for displays and lighting\n  - Batteries: La in NiMH batteries\nStoichiometry\
  \ (example, Ce):\n  - Ce2O3 + 3H2SO4 → Ce2(SO4)3 + 3H2O (leaching)\n  - Ce2(SO4)3\
  \ + 3 H2C2O4 → Ce2(C2O4)3 + 3H2SO4 (precipitation)\n  - Ce2(C2O4)3 → Ce2O3 + 3CO\
  \ + 3CO2 (calcination at 800°C)\nSeparation challenges:\n  - REE have very similar\
  \ chemistry (all 3+ cations)\n  - Separation requires many stages (10-50 extraction\
  \ stages)\n  - Extremely complex process (solvent extraction cascades)\n  - Individual\
  \ REE separation beyond first-gen ISRU capability\nMixed REO vs. separated REE:\n\
  \  - Mixed REO: Easier, 10-20 extraction stages\n  - Separated REE: Extremely difficult,\
  \ requires specialized equipment\n  - For first lunar use: Mixed REO may be acceptable\n\
  \  - Refine to pure REE only if absolutely necessary\nAdvantages: KREEP concentration\
  \ 5× higher than typical Earth ores\n  Multiple valuable elements (REE, U, Th, P,\
  \ K)\n  Enables high-tech applications (magnets, superconductors)\nDisadvantages:\
  \ Extremely complex process (many stages)\n  Energy intensive (acid production,\
  \ leaching, calcination)\n  Requires exotic reagents (organic extractants)\n  Low\
  \ concentration (0.12% even in KREEP)\n  Not economical for first-generation ISRU\n\
  Lunar context: KREEP regions well-mapped (Procellarum, Imbrium)\n  Essential for\
  \ advanced manufacturing (motors, generators, sensors)\n  Likely deferred to later\
  \ ISRU stages (after basics established)\n  But critical for long-term sustainability\n\
  Alternative processing:\n  - Pyrometallurgical: High-temp chlorination/fluorination\n\
  \  - Ion exchange: Similar to solvent extraction but solid resin\n  - Electrochemical:\
  \ Direct electrolysis of REE salts\nUranium and Thorium co-extraction:\n  - U and\
  \ Th also leach with REE (both 4+, 3+ cations)\n  - Must separate or manage radioactive\
  \ elements\n  - U/Th potentially valuable for nuclear power\n  - Or hazard requiring\
  \ careful disposal\nPhosphorus co-extraction:\n  - KREEP rich in phosphate minerals\
  \ (apatite)\n  - P extracted as phosphoric acid (H3PO4)\n  - Valuable for fertilizer\
  \ (agriculture on Moon/Mars)\n  - Or phosphorus for semiconductors (dopant)\nPotassium\
  \ recovery:\n  - K dissolves as sulfate or chloride\n  - Separate from REE by solvent\
  \ extraction\n  - Valuable for fertilizer, glass production\nEnvironmental/safety\
  \ concerns:\n  - Concentrated acids (H2SO4, HCl) hazardous\n  - Radioactive U, Th\
  \ require shielding and containment\n  - Organic solvents (flammable, toxic)\n \
  \ - Must be closed-loop, zero-release system\nScale requirements:\n  - 1 tonne KREEP\
  \ ore → ~1.2 kg mixed REO\n  - For 1 kg pure Nd: ~6 tonnes KREEP ore (if 180 ppm\
  \ Nd)\n  - Large-scale mining required for useful quantities\nEnergy analysis:\n\
  \  - Acid production: ~10 kWh/kg acid (if from scratch)\n  - Leaching/heating: ~20\
  \ kWh/tonne ore\n  - Solvent extraction: ~50 kWh/kg REO\n  - Calcination: ~5 kWh/kg\
  \ REO\n  - Total: ~150 kWh/kg REO (very energy intensive)\nComparison to Earth REE\
  \ processing:\n  - Earth: ~0.02-0.1% REE typical (bastnäsite, monazite)\n  - KREEP:\
  \ ~0.12% REE (slightly better)\n  - Similar complexity, similar energy costs\nTrade-offs:\n\
  \  - Import REE from Earth vs. extract from KREEP\n  - Early stages: Import likely\
  \ cheaper\n  - Long-term: In-situ extraction necessary for self-sufficiency\n  -\
  \ Critical decision point: When does KREEP mining become viable?\nRecommended timeline:\n\
  \  - Phase 1 (years 0-10): Import REE from Earth\n  - Phase 2 (years 10-30): Develop\
  \ KREEP processing pilot plant\n  - Phase 3 (years 30+): Full-scale KREEP mining\
  \ and REE extraction\n"
