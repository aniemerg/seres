  Rare earth element (REE) extraction from KREEP basalts (advanced process).
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt
  Purpose: Extract REE for permanent magnets (NdFeB), superconductors (NbTi), catalysts
  KREEP: Potassium (K), Rare Earth Elements (REE), Phosphorus (P) enriched basalts
  Concentration: ~1200 ppm average REE (0.12%), up to 5× higher than Earth
  WARNING: Complex, energy-intensive process - not suitable for first-generation ISRU
  Process details:
    1. Locate KREEP regions using gamma-ray spectroscopy
       - Detect U, Th signatures (correlate with REE)
       - U/Th ratio ~0.27 typical for KREEP
       - Imbrium basin, Oceanus Procellarum highest concentrations
    2. Mine and crush KREEP basalt ore
    3. Roast ore at 600°C to oxidize Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺ (if Ce separation desired)
    4. Acid leaching with concentrated H2SO4 (or HCl)
       - Heat to 80-100°C for several hours
       - REE dissolve as sulfates or chlorides
       - REE³⁺ + 3/2 H2SO4 → REE2(SO4)3 + 3/2 H2
    5. Filter leach liquor from insoluble residue
    6. Solvent extraction for REE concentration and separation
       - Organic extractants: D2EHPA, Cyanex, TODGA
       - Multiple stages for individual REE separation
       - pH-dependent extraction selectivity
    7. Strip REE from organic phase with acid
    8. Precipitate REE as oxalates: REE³⁺ + oxalic acid → REE2(C2O4)3
    9. Calcinate oxalates to oxides: REE2(C2O4)3 → REE2O3 + CO + CO2
    10. Further purification if individual REE needed (beyond scope)
  Products:
    - Mixed rare earth oxides (REO): ~0.12% of ore mass, mixture of La, Ce, Nd, Y, etc.
    - Leach residue: Depleted ore, may contain valuable minerals
    - Acids: Partially recycled
  REE concentration in KREEP:
    - Total REE: ~1200 ppm (0.12%) average
    - Y: ~300 ppm (most abundant)
    - Ce: ~300 ppm
    - Nd: ~180 ppm (critical for magnets)
    - La: ~150 ppm
    - Sm: ~50 ppm
    - Gd: ~50 ppm
    - Pr: ~40 ppm
    - Dy: ~30 ppm (critical for magnets)
    - Others: Eu (~3-5 ppm), Tb, Ho, Er, Yb, Lu (each <30 ppm)
  KREEP detection:
    - Gamma-ray spectroscopy: Detect U (3-10 ppm), Th (10-40 ppm)
    - U/Th ratio ~0.27 diagnostic for KREEP
    - Lunar Prospector gamma-ray data shows hotspots
    - Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT) richest region
  REE applications (critical for advanced technology):
    - NdFeB magnets: Strongest permanent magnets (Nd, Dy additions)
    - Electric motors: High-power-density motors (robotics, spacecraft)
    - Generators: Lightweight, high-efficiency power generation
    - Superconductors: NbTi superconducting wire (Nb is REE-associated)
    - Catalysts: La, Ce for various chemical processes
    - Lasers: Nd:YAG lasers (Nd-doped yttrium aluminum garnet)
    - Phosphors: Eu, Tb for displays and lighting
    - Batteries: La in NiMH batteries
  Stoichiometry (example, Ce):
    - Ce2O3 + 3H2SO4 → Ce2(SO4)3 + 3H2O (leaching)
    - Ce2(SO4)3 + 3 H2C2O4 → Ce2(C2O4)3 + 3H2SO4 (precipitation)
    - Ce2(C2O4)3 → Ce2O3 + 3CO + 3CO2 (calcination at 800°C)
  Separation challenges:
    - REE have very similar chemistry (all 3+ cations)
    - Separation requires many stages (10-50 extraction stages)
    - Extremely complex process (solvent extraction cascades)
    - Individual REE separation beyond first-gen ISRU capability
  Mixed REO vs. separated REE:
    - Mixed REO: Easier, 10-20 extraction stages
    - Separated REE: Extremely difficult, requires specialized equipment
    - For first lunar use: Mixed REO may be acceptable
    - Refine to pure REE only if absolutely necessary
  Advantages: KREEP concentration 5× higher than typical Earth ores
    Multiple valuable elements (REE, U, Th, P, K)
    Enables high-tech applications (magnets, superconductors)
  Disadvantages: Extremely complex process (many stages)
    Energy intensive (acid production, leaching, calcination)
    Requires exotic reagents (organic extractants)
    Low concentration (0.12% even in KREEP)
    Not economical for first-generation ISRU
  Lunar context: KREEP regions well-mapped (Procellarum, Imbrium)
    Essential for advanced manufacturing (motors, generators, sensors)
    Likely deferred to later ISRU stages (after basics established)
    But critical for long-term sustainability
  Alternative processing:
    - Pyrometallurgical: High-temp chlorination/fluorination
    - Ion exchange: Similar to solvent extraction but solid resin
    - Electrochemical: Direct electrolysis of REE salts
  Uranium and Thorium co-extraction:
    - U and Th also leach with REE (both 4+, 3+ cations)
    - Must separate or manage radioactive elements
    - U/Th potentially valuable for nuclear power
    - Or hazard requiring careful disposal
  Phosphorus co-extraction:
    - KREEP rich in phosphate minerals (apatite)
    - P extracted as phosphoric acid (H3PO4)
    - Valuable for fertilizer (agriculture on Moon/Mars)
    - Or phosphorus for semiconductors (dopant)
  Potassium recovery:
    - K dissolves as sulfate or chloride
    - Separate from REE by solvent extraction
    - Valuable for fertilizer, glass production
  Environmental/safety concerns:
    - Concentrated acids (H2SO4, HCl) hazardous
    - Radioactive U, Th require shielding and containment
    - Organic solvents (flammable, toxic)
    - Must be closed-loop, zero-release system
  Scale requirements:
    - 1 tonne KREEP ore → ~1.2 kg mixed REO
    - For 1 kg pure Nd: ~6 tonnes KREEP ore (if 180 ppm Nd)
    - Large-scale mining required for useful quantities
  Energy analysis:
    - Acid production: ~10 kWh/kg acid (if from scratch)
    - Leaching/heating: ~20 kWh/tonne ore
    - Solvent extraction: ~50 kWh/kg REO
    - Calcination: ~5 kWh/kg REO
    - Total: ~150 kWh/kg REO (very energy intensive)
  Comparison to Earth REE processing:
    - Earth: ~0.02-0.1% REE typical (bastnäsite, monazite)
    - KREEP: ~0.12% REE (slightly better)
    - Similar complexity, similar energy costs
  Trade-offs:
    - Import REE from Earth vs. extract from KREEP
    - Early stages: Import likely cheaper
    - Long-term: In-situ extraction necessary for self-sufficiency
    - Critical decision point: When does KREEP mining become viable?
  Recommended timeline:
    - Phase 1 (years 0-10): Import REE from Earth
    - Phase 2 (years 10-30): Develop KREEP processing pilot plant
    - Phase 3 (years 30+): Full-scale KREEP mining and REE extraction
