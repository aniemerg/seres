  Methanol synthesis from carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas).
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt
  Reaction: CO + 2H2 → CH3OH (exothermic)
  Temperature: 250°C
  Pressure: 5-10 MPa (50-100 bar)
  Catalyst: Alumina (Al2O3 from anorthite processing)
  Process: Catalytic synthesis under pressure
  Purpose: Second step in silicone plastic synthesis chain
  Chemical feedstock for methyl chloride production
  Industrial solvent and fuel
  Process details:
    1. Syngas (CO + H2) from steam reforming
    2. Compressed to 5-10 MPa
    3. Passed over alumina catalyst at 250°C
    4. Methanol (CH3OH) produced
    5. Condense liquid methanol
    6. Unreacted syngas recycled
  Products:
    - CH3OH (methanol/methyl alcohol): Feedstock for silicone synthesis
  Alumina catalyst source:
    - Anorthite processing: CaAl2Si2O8 → Al2O3
    - HCl leaching: CaAl2Si2O8 + 8HCl → Al2O3 + ...
    - Carbothermal: CaAl2Si2O8 + 4C → Al2O3 + ...
  Alcohol determination:
    - Methanol from methanol (CH3OH yields polydimethylsiloxane PDMS)
    - Higher alcohols yield different siloxanes
  Next step: CH3OH + HCl → CH3Cl + H2O (methyl chloride for Rochow process)
  Stoichiometry: CO (28g) + 2H2 (4g) → CH3OH (32g)
  Mass fractions: 114% CH3OH from CO input
  Syngas ratio: CO:H2 = 1:2 required (steam reforming gives 1:3, adjust)
  Advantages: Exothermic reaction (releases heat)
  High conversion efficiency (>90%)
  Proven industrial process
  Alumina catalyst from abundant lunar anorthite
  Moderate temperature (vs steam reforming)
  Disadvantages: High pressure requirement (5-10 MPa)
  Equilibrium-limited (requires recycle of unreacted syngas)
  Catalyst poisoning by sulfur and chlorides
  Applications:
    - Silicone synthesis: → methyl chloride → dimethyldichlorosilane → PDMS
    - Chemical feedstock: Formaldehyde, acetic acid, MTBE
    - Fuel: Methanol fuel cells, combustion engines
    - Solvent: Industrial processes
  Lunar context: Critical intermediate for silicone plastics
  Silicone essential for: Wire insulation, seals, elastomers, gaskets
  Limited alternatives to silicone for flexible electrical insulation
  Methanol also useful as solvent for chemical processing
  Alternative alcohols (ethanol, etc.) require different synthesis routes
  Silicone chain: CH4 → syngas → CH3OH → CH3Cl → (CH3)2SiCl2 → PDMS
