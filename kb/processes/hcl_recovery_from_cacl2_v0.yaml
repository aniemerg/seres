  Recovery of hydrochloric acid from calcium chloride via high-temperature hydrolysis.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, Lunar-Demandite.txt
  Reaction: CaCl2 + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + 2HCl (above 425°C)
  Temperature: >425°C (high temperature required for reaction)
  Process: Steam hydrolysis to regenerate HCl
  Purpose: Recover HCl from waste/spent CaCl2
  Close hydrochloric acid recycling loop
  Alternative to HCl generation from NaCl
  Process details:
    1. CaCl2 (from Solvay by-product or other sources)
    2. High-temperature steam (H2O vapor above 425°C)
    3. Hydrolysis produces HCl gas and Ca(OH)2 solid
    4. HCl gas collected by condensation
    5. Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime) as solid by-product
  Products:
    - HCl (hydrochloric acid gas): Recycled for artificial weathering
    - Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime): Cement component, CO2 capture
  Calcium hydroxide applications:
    - Cement production: Ca(OH)2 + CO2 → CaCO3 + H2O (carbonation)
    - Water treatment: pH adjustment
    - CO2 capture: Forms calcium carbonate
  Stoichiometry: CaCl2 (111g) + 2H2O (36g) → Ca(OH)2 (74g) + 2HCl (73g)
  Mass fractions: 66.7% Ca(OH)2, 65.7% HCl from CaCl2 input
  HCl recycling chain:
    1. HCl used in processes (e.g., anorthite leaching)
    2. Regenerated in leaching: CaAl2Si2O8 + HCl → CaCl2 + ...
    3. This process: CaCl2 + H2O → HCl + Ca(OH)2
    4. HCl recycled to step 1
  Advantages: Recovers HCl from spent CaCl2
  Ca(OH)2 useful for cement and CO2 capture
  Closes HCl recycling loop
  Reduces reliance on NaCl import for HCl generation
  Disadvantages: High temperature requirement (>425°C)
  Additional processing step
  Not all CaCl2 should be hydrolyzed (need for FFC electrolyte)
  Lunar context: Enables true HCl recycling
  CaCl2 from Solvay process can be split:
    - Portion to FFC electrolyte
    - Portion hydrolyzed to recover HCl
  Ca(OH)2 useful for cement (habitat construction)
  Alternative to constant NaCl consumption
  Balance: Need both FFC electrolyte AND HCl recycling
  Optimization required based on system demands
