  Zone refining for achieving extreme purity levels in silicon for semiconductors.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt
  Process: Thermal zone melting with impurity segregation
  Temperature: ~1600°C (local melting zone)
  Purpose: Achieve 9-11 nines purity (99.9999999-99.999999999% pure)
  Essential for semiconductor manufacturing
  Process details:
    1. Silicon ingot from Siemens process (polycrystalline)
    2. Mount in horizontal apparatus
    3. RF induction coil creates narrow molten zone (~1 cm wide)
    4. Slowly translate molten zone along ingot (mm/hr)
    5. Impurities preferentially stay in liquid phase
    6. Solid crystallizes behind zone with lower impurity
    7. Multiple passes (10-50) progressively concentrate impurities
    8. Cut off impure ends, recycle to earlier processing
  Physical principle: Distribution coefficient k = Csolid/Cliquid
    - For most impurities in Si: k < 1 (reject into liquid)
    - Examples: B (k=0.8), P (k=0.35), Al (k=0.002)
    - Impurities swept to end of ingot
  Products:
    - Ultra-pure silicon: Center section of ingot
    - Impure ends: Recycled to Siemens process
  Purity levels achievable:
    - Starting: 99.9999% (6 nines, from Siemens)
    - After 10 passes: 99.9999999% (9 nines)
    - After 30-50 passes: 99.999999999% (11 nines)
  Critical impurities removed:
    - Boron (p-type dopant): Must control to <0.1 ppb
    - Phosphorus (n-type dopant): Must control to <0.1 ppb
    - Transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni): Recombination centers
    - Carbon: Forms SiC defects
  Advantages: Achieves extreme purity levels
    No chemical reagents required
    Physics-based separation (thermodynamic)
    Scalable to large ingots
  Disadvantages: Very slow process (days per ingot)
    Energy intensive (maintain molten zone)
    Requires multiple passes for highest purity
    ~2% material loss to impure ends per pass
  Lunar context: Essential for electronics manufacturing
    Semiconductor devices require 9+ nines purity
    Photovoltaics can use lower purity (6-7 nines)
    Zone refining is final purification step
  Alternative: Czochralski pulling also achieves high purity
    But zone refining can reach even higher levels
  Process variations:
    - Vertical zone refining (better for vacuum)
    - Horizontal (shown here, easier mechanically)
    - Float-zone (contactless, highest purity)
  Yield: 98% ultra-pure silicon per pass
    Impure ends (2%) recycled to Siemens or earlier
  Temperature control critical:
    - Too hot: Excessive evaporation, Si loss
    - Too cold: Zone freezes, process stops
    - Must maintain 1600°C ± 10°C in zone
  Atmosphere: Inert (Ar) or vacuum
    Prevents oxidation and contamination
  Post-processing: Czochralski growth into single crystal
    Or direct use as polycrystalline for some applications
