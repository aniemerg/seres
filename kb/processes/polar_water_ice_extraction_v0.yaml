notes: "Extraction of water ice from permanently shadowed craters at lunar poles.\n\
  Source: Power-on-the-Moon-using-ISRU.txt, Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt\nLocation:\
  \ Permanently shadowed craters (PSCs) at north and south poles\nTemperature: ~40\
  \ K (-233°C) in PSCs\nConcentration: 5.6% ± 2.9% by mass (LCROSS impact data)\n\
  Purpose: Extract water for life support, propellant, hydrogen source\nHigher concentration\
  \ than volatile extraction from regolith\nProcess details:\n  1. Heliostats on peaks\
  \ of eternal light reflect sunlight to PSCs\n  2. Solar arrays in PSC powered by\
  \ reflected light\n  3. Drill into frozen regolith to depth (subsurface ice)\n \
  \ 4. Option A - Direct heating: Heat ice directly, capture sublimed vapor\n  5.\
  \ Option B - Heater insertion: Insert heaters into boreholes\n  6. Ice sublimes/melts,\
  \ vapor captured in cold trap canopy\n  7. Condense water vapor to liquid or keep\
  \ as ice\nProducts:\n  - H2O (water ice/liquid): 5.6% average, up to 8.5% in some\
  \ locations\n  - Dry regolith: Processed material\nIce characteristics:\n  - Rock-hard\
  \ when frozen (~40 K)\n  - Drilling difficult (similar to drilling concrete)\n \
  \ - May be in layers or pockets (not uniformly distributed)\n  - Subsurface ice\
  \ insulated by dry regolith overburden\nWater ice deposits:\n  - Total PSC area:\
  \ >31,000 km² (both poles)\n  - Estimated inventory: 3-6 × 10¹² kg (3-6 billion\
  \ tonnes)\n  - Cabeus crater (south pole): High concentration region\n  - 40+ craters\
  \ at north pole with water potential\nEnergy challenges:\n  - PSCs permanently shadowed\
  \ (no direct sunlight)\n  - Heliostats required: Reflect sunlight from peaks of\
  \ eternal light\n  - Distance: ~20 km vertical and horizontal\n  - Three heliostats\
  \ minimum for continuous coverage\nHeliostat system:\n  - Mirrors on peaks of eternal\
  \ light (continuous solar access)\n  - Beam sunlight to PSC floor (photovoltaics\
  \ or direct heating)\n  - Complex pointing and tracking\n  - Alternative: Nuclear\
  \ power for PSC operations\nStoichiometry: 1000 kg frozen regolith → 56 kg water\
  \ ice (5.6%)\nComparison to volatile extraction:\n  - Polar ice: 5.6% H2O by mass\n\
  \  - Regolith volatiles: 0.046% H by mass (~0.041% H2O equivalent)\n  - Polar ice\
  \ ~140x higher water concentration\nAdvantages: Much higher concentration than regolith\
  \ volatiles\nLarge total inventory (billions of tonnes)\nDirect water extraction\
  \ (not just H)\nDisadvantages: Extreme environment (40 K, permanently dark)\nComplex\
  \ infrastructure (heliostats, drilling, heating)\nRugged terrain (SPA basin: 11\
  \ km elevation changes)\nDistance from potential base sites (peaks of eternal light)\n\
  Lunar context: Critical water source for life support\nHydrogen for reduction processes\
  \ (ilmenite, etc.)\nOxygen via electrolysis\nPropellant/oxidizer (though wasteful\
  \ of scarce resource)\nSustainability concern: Burning H2/O2 as propellant unsustainable\n\
  Better uses: Life support recycling, chemical processes\nAlternative propulsion:\
  \ Solar-electric, electromagnetic launchers\n"
