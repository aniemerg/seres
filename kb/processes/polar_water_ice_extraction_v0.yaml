  Extraction of water ice from permanently shadowed craters at lunar poles.
  Source: Power-on-the-Moon-using-ISRU.txt, Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt
  Location: Permanently shadowed craters (PSCs) at north and south poles
  Temperature: ~40 K (-233°C) in PSCs
  Concentration: 5.6% ± 2.9% by mass (LCROSS impact data)
  Purpose: Extract water for life support, propellant, hydrogen source
  Higher concentration than volatile extraction from regolith
  Process details:
    1. Heliostats on peaks of eternal light reflect sunlight to PSCs
    2. Solar arrays in PSC powered by reflected light
    3. Drill into frozen regolith to depth (subsurface ice)
    4. Option A - Direct heating: Heat ice directly, capture sublimed vapor
    5. Option B - Heater insertion: Insert heaters into boreholes
    6. Ice sublimes/melts, vapor captured in cold trap canopy
    7. Condense water vapor to liquid or keep as ice
  Products:
    - H2O (water ice/liquid): 5.6% average, up to 8.5% in some locations
    - Dry regolith: Processed material
  Ice characteristics:
    - Rock-hard when frozen (~40 K)
    - Drilling difficult (similar to drilling concrete)
    - May be in layers or pockets (not uniformly distributed)
    - Subsurface ice insulated by dry regolith overburden
  Water ice deposits:
    - Total PSC area: >31,000 km² (both poles)
    - Estimated inventory: 3-6 × 10¹² kg (3-6 billion tonnes)
    - Cabeus crater (south pole): High concentration region
    - 40+ craters at north pole with water potential
  Energy challenges:
    - PSCs permanently shadowed (no direct sunlight)
    - Heliostats required: Reflect sunlight from peaks of eternal light
    - Distance: ~20 km vertical and horizontal
    - Three heliostats minimum for continuous coverage
  Heliostat system:
    - Mirrors on peaks of eternal light (continuous solar access)
    - Beam sunlight to PSC floor (photovoltaics or direct heating)
    - Complex pointing and tracking
    - Alternative: Nuclear power for PSC operations
  Stoichiometry: 1000 kg frozen regolith → 56 kg water ice (5.6%)
  Comparison to volatile extraction:
    - Polar ice: 5.6% H2O by mass
    - Regolith volatiles: 0.046% H by mass (~0.041% H2O equivalent)
    - Polar ice ~140x higher water concentration
  Advantages: Much higher concentration than regolith volatiles
  Large total inventory (billions of tonnes)
  Direct water extraction (not just H)
  Disadvantages: Extreme environment (40 K, permanently dark)
  Complex infrastructure (heliostats, drilling, heating)
  Rugged terrain (SPA basin: 11 km elevation changes)
  Distance from potential base sites (peaks of eternal light)
  Lunar context: Critical water source for life support
  Hydrogen for reduction processes (ilmenite, etc.)
  Oxygen via electrolysis
  Propellant/oxidizer (though wasteful of scarce resource)
  Sustainability concern: Burning H2/O2 as propellant unsustainable
  Better uses: Life support recycling, chemical processes
  Alternative propulsion: Solar-electric, electromagnetic launchers
