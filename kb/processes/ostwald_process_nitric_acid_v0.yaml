  Ostwald process for producing nitric acid from ammonia via catalytic oxidation.
  Source: Sustainable-ISRU-on-the-Moon.txt, Lunar-Demandite.txt
  Stage 1 - Ammonia oxidation: 4NH3 + 5O2 → 4NO + 6H2O
  Stage 2 - NO oxidation: 2NO + O2 → 2NO2
  Stage 3 - Absorption: 3NO2 + H2O → 2HNO3 + NO (NO recycled)
  Overall: NH3 + 2O2 → HNO3 + H2O
  Temperature: 600-800°C for stage 1 (catalytic oxidation)
  Pressure: 400-1000 kPa (4-10 bar)
  Catalyst: Platinum on nickel (terrestrial) or tungsten carbide on nickel (lunar)
  Process sequence:
    1. Ammonia vaporized and mixed with air/oxygen
    2. Catalytic oxidation to nitric oxide (NO) and water vapor
    3. Further oxidation of NO to nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
    4. Absorption of NO2 in water to form HNO3
    5. Unreacted NO recycled back to oxidation stage
  Catalyst considerations:
    - Terrestrial: Platinum gauze (expensive, not available on Moon)
    - Lunar alternative: Tungsten carbide on nickel support
    - Nickel from Mond process (meteorite sources)
    - Tungsten from density-separated meteorite inclusions
  Products:
    - HNO3 (nitric acid): Critical reagent for HCl production from NaCl
    - H2O (water): Process water, recyclable
  Nitric acid applications:
    - React with NaCl to generate HCl gas: NaCl + HNO3 → HCl + NaNO3
    - Chemical synthesis, oxidizer, etching agent
    - Propellant oxidizer (when mixed with fuel)
  Stoichiometry: NH3 (17g) + 2O2 (64g) → HNO3 (63g) + H2O (18g)
  Mass fractions: 371% HNO3 from ammonia input
  Nitrogen source: Haber-Bosch synthesis from volatile N2 extraction
  Oxygen source: Water electrolysis or mineral reduction (abundant)
  Advantages: Well-established industrial process
  Enables HCl production from imported NaCl
  HCl critical for artificial weathering and recycling loops
  Disadvantages: Requires scarce nitrogen (from volatiles)
  Pt catalyst unavailable (must use WC/Ni alternative)
  Multi-stage process with gas handling
  Lunar context: Nitrogen is severely scarce (~80 ppm in regolith volatiles)
  Must be carefully husbanded and recycled
  HNO3 → HCl → recycled as NaCl regeneration loop
  Essential for unlocking chlorine chemistry with NaCl import
