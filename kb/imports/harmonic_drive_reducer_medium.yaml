name: Harmonic drive reducer (medium)
mass: 2.0
unit: kg
material_class: steel
is_import: true
notes: "High-precision harmonic drive gear reducer for robot joints.\n\nZero-backlash\
  \ design critical for \xB10.5mm repeatability requirement.\n\nVariants:\n- Large:\
  \ 100:1 ratio, 50mm diameter, for joints 1-3 (base, shoulder, elbow)\n- Small: 80:1\
  \ ratio, 40mm diameter, for joints 4-6 (wrist)\n\nComponents:\n- Wave generator\
  \ (elliptical cam with bearing)\n- Flexspline (thin-walled cup with external teeth)\n\
  - Circular spline (rigid ring with internal teeth)\n\nMaterials: High-strength alloy\
  \ steel (flexspline), tool steel (circular spline).\n\nManufacturing: Precision\
  \ machining + heat treatment. Requires controlled\natmosphere furnace and advanced\
  \ metrology for tooth accuracy.\n\nInitially import. Lunar manufacturing possible\
  \ with precision grinding\nand heat treatment capability.\n\nDesign reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md\
  \ section 3.2.2.\n"
