  Capacitive touch sensor for collision detection in robotic grippers.

  Detects contact when conductive object (or human hand) approaches sensor
  electrode, changing capacitance.

  Specifications:
  - Type: Capacitive proximity/touch switch
  - Sensing range: 0-10 mm
  - Response time: <100 ms
  - Output: Digital (on/off) or analog (distance)
  - Protection: IP65 (dust and water resistant)

  Typical use: Mounted on gripper fingers to detect when part is grasped
  or if gripper contacts obstacle.

  Components:
  - Capacitive sensing electrode (copper or aluminum)
  - Sensing IC (capacitance-to-digital converter)
  - Small PCB
  - Housing (plastic or metal)

  Manufacturing: Sensing IC import required. Electrode and housing
  manufacturable from lunar materials.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.5.4.
