  Conservative Mode check:

  - Searched for: biocide, antimicrobial, preservative additives

  - No equivalent found in KB

  - Referenced in: cutting_fluid_formulation_v0


  Function: Prevents bacterial/fungal growth in water-based metalworking fluids


  Lunar context: May not be strictly necessary on Moon due to:

  - Vacuum environment (no ambient microorganisms)

  - Closed fluid systems (minimal contamination)

  - Sterile manufacturing environment


  Earth context: Essential for cutting fluids to prevent:

  - Biological fouling and odor

  - Fluid degradation and pH changes

  - Worker health hazards


  Typical biocides: Formaldehyde releasers, isothiazolinones, triazines


  Created per Conservative Mode: Referenced in process, but may be optional

  for lunar manufacturing. Consider as import or omit with process note.


  Recommendation: Import small quantity or formulate from simpler chemicals

  (e.g., dilute sodium hydroxide for pH control serves dual purpose).
