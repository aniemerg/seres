notes: "Nitrile rubber (NBR) for molding seals, gaskets, and flexible components.\n\
  Synthetic rubber with excellent oil and fuel resistance.\n\nProperties:\n- Oil and\
  \ fuel resistant\n- Good abrasion resistance\n- Temperature range: -40\xB0C to +120\xB0\
  C\n- Used for O-rings, seals, gaskets, hoses\n\nLunar production challenges:\n-\
  \ Requires petroleum-derived monomers (butadiene, acrylonitrile)\n- Complex polymerization\
  \ process\n- Alternative: Silicone rubber (can be made from lunar silicon)\n\nLikely\
  \ import until petrochemical processing established or alternative elastomers developed.\n"
