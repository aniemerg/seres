notes: "Corrosion inhibitor additive for water-based metalworking fluids.\n\nImported\
  \ due to low consumption rate and specialty formulation requirements.\n\nFunction:\
  \ Prevents rust and corrosion of metal workpieces and machine tools\nin contact\
  \ with water-based cutting fluids.\n\nCommon corrosion inhibitor types:\n- Sodium\
  \ nitrite (NaNO2): Simple inorganic inhibitor, effective for ferrous metals\n- Sodium\
  \ benzoate (C7H5NaO2): Organic inhibitor, less toxic\n- Amine-based compounds: Film-forming\
  \ inhibitors (e.g., ethanolamine, morpholine)\n- Phosphates/molybdates: Passivating\
  \ inhibitors (e.g., Na3PO4, Na2MoO4)\n\nTypical usage:\n- Concentration in cutting\
  \ fluids: 1-5%\n- Consumption rate: ~3% of total cutting fluid mass\n- Very low\
  \ overall consumption due to fluid recycling\n\nLocal synthesis possibility (sodium\
  \ nitrite):\n- NaOH + HNO2 \u2192 NaNO2 + H2O (direct, but HNO2 is unstable)\n-\
  \ OR: NaNO3 (from NaOH + HNO3) \u2192 reduce to NaNO2 (requires reducing agent)\n\
  - Reduction methods: Pb + NaNO3 \u2192 NaNO2 + PbO (lead process, toxic)\n- OR thermal\
  \ decomposition with carbon: NaNO3 + C \u2192 NaNO2 + CO (difficult to control)\n\
  \nImport justification:\n- Very low mass requirement (kg quantities, not tonnes)\n\
  - Specialty chemical formulation for optimal performance\n- Synthesis routes are\
  \ complex or require toxic intermediates\n- Minimal impact on material closure (recycled\
  \ with cutting fluid)\n- Cost-effective to import for early bootstrap\n\nLocal manufacturing\
  \ path (future, if needed):\n- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH): Available from chloralkali\
  \ electrolysis\n- Nitric acid (HNO3): Available from Ostwald process (NH3 + O2)\n\
  - Synthesis: Multi-step process to produce sodium nitrite\n- Quality control: Purity\
  \ testing for corrosion inhibition effectiveness\n\nConservative Mode check completed:\n\
  - No equivalent item found within 5\xD7 magnitude\n"
