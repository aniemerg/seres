  LED ring light for machine vision illumination.

  Provides uniform diffuse lighting for camera-based part inspection and
  pose estimation.

  Specifications:
  - Configuration: Circular array of white LEDs
  - Power: 12W per ring
  - Color temperature: 5500K (daylight white)
  - Mounting: Surrounds camera lens (coaxial lighting)
  - Diffuser: Acrylic or glass for uniform illumination
  - Diameter: ~80-100 mm

  Components:
  - 24-48× white LEDs (high-brightness)
  - Aluminum heatsink ring
  - LED driver electronics (constant current)
  - Acrylic diffuser
  - Mounting bracket

  Power: 12V DC input, regulated by constant-current driver.

  Manufacturing: LEDs import. Aluminum heatsink and mounting from lunar Al.
  Acrylic diffuser from synthesized polymer or lunar glass. Imported until LED and driver electronics are manufacturable.

  Design reference: docs/labor_bot_design_memo.md section 3.5.5.
