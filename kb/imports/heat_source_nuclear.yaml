  Nuclear heat source for thermionic generator. Imported due to fissile material
  (Pu-238 or similar isotope) and reactor-grade components requiring specialized
  manufacturing, safety certification, and regulatory compliance not feasible for
  early lunar base. RTG-style heat source providing thermal energy for thermionic
  conversion.
