# Repository Cleanup - December 21, 2025

## Summary

Cleaned up repository structure to improve organization and reduce clutter. Removed obsolete files, archived completed work, and reorganized scripts.

## Actions Taken

### Files Deleted (5 files)
- `main.py` - Obsolete placeholder ("Hello world" script)
- `test_base_builder.py` - Obsolete test file
- `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES_SUMMARY.md` - Session work summary (no longer needed)
- `recipe_fix_summary.md` - Session work summary (no longer needed)
- `CLI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Duplicate of `docs/CLI_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md`

### Files Archived (5 files)

**Planning docs** (moved to `docs/archive/planning/`):
- `queue_filtering_plan.md` - Planning document for queue filtering feature (implemented)
- `queue_config_filtering_plan.md` - Design document for config-based filtering (implemented)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_QUEUE_FILTERING.md` - Implementation summary (completed)
- `queue_multi_agent.md` - Queue usage guide (superseded by docs/README.md)

**Session work** (moved to `docs/archive/session_work/`):
- `motor_production_manifest.md` - Motor production planning from simulation session

### Files Reorganized (1 file)
- `build_drive_motor.py` → `scripts/build_drive_motor.py`

### Directories Removed (1 directory)
- `design/base_builder/` - Empty directory (removed)

### New Structure Created
- `docs/archive/` - Archive root
- `docs/archive/planning/` - Completed planning documents
- `docs/archive/session_work/` - Session work and one-off analysis

## Current State

Top-level directory now contains only:
- Configuration files (.env, .kbconfig.yaml, .gitignore)
- Project metadata (pyproject.toml, uv.lock, README.md)
- System files (.DS_Store)

All scripts are now in `scripts/` directory.
All documentation is in `docs/` with archives properly organized.

## Rationale

This cleanup supports the project's focus on:
1. **Clear organization** - Scripts in scripts/, docs in docs/, archives separated
2. **Reduced confusion** - No duplicate or outdated files in main directories
3. **Preserved history** - Archived rather than deleted where appropriate
4. **Better onboarding** - Cleaner structure for new contributors
